Van Loock stefan,I cancelled a investment on 12/3. N26 didnât give back my money and refuse  to do it. You can mail them as much as you want. They just steal your money.

Anton Pavliuchenko,"They blocked my account, and the support team couldnât explain anything to me. After saying âwait for an email,â they would simply end the chat unilaterally.A few months after the account was blocked, I received an email requesting two documents, which I provided. A few months later, I received a second email saying I had been denied services and was advised to withdraw my funds to another account. But my account had been blocked. In this case, they told me to send the details of another account and promised to âconsider the possibility of a refund.âAt this moment, I canât access the bankâs app, and they still havenât returned my money.I didnât know a bank could just take your money without explaining why.I donât recommend them.

Sergey,"The support is really bad. You need to go over the bot first which sometimes is really bad. Then it takes a lot of time to assign an agent to you. After some waiting time they say that your agent is not really there anymore and they found you a new one. The new one would say ""how can I help you"" despite you already explained it a couple of times. And this is not just a singular experience âÂ this has been an experience throughout the years, although I must say that before it was even worse sometimes.","Hey Sergey,Thanks for sharing your feedback.We are very sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support.

eytriplesee,"As an existing n26 customer I wanted to open a joint account with my partner. I was told I couldnât hold more than one account and would need to close my account and open a new one. After waiting two weeks for my account closure to be finalised, I applied for the new account only to be denied for âlegal reasonsâ that were never explained to me. After several attempts trying to get assistance from n26âs absolutely abysmal customer service, I finally gave up. N26 not only lost me as a customer but my fiancÃ© has also closed his account with them so that we can sign up for a joint account elsewhere, without all the fuss.P.S. despite what Peter from N26 has responded, all you get from the staff in the chat is a pasted auto reply.","Hey, Thank you for the review.

Nelson Botelho,"On March 18th my account was closed without any explanation or any reason with almost 11.000â¬ inside, their support team itâs terrible, they will just give you copy past answers, when they reply if they reply! Itâs terrible, i was a customer since 2021 never had an issue i could never see this happening so i was trusting N26 with all my money. On March 20th, theyâve asked me for proof of funds, and an alternative bank account to send my money to, now iâm waiting on my money, but they didnât even bother about replying to my e-mail. They donât care, they will just leave you stranded without your money, while they do what they feel like doing, they donât reply, calling them doesnât solve anything, overall terrible experience, it seems like no one knows what they are doing.

Michal,"Absolutely unreliable support. They blocked my account. I contacted support, and their response? ""Nothing happened, just a routine account check. Most of the time, you wonât even notice that we do these checks."" I thought, okay, no problem. But the entire day passed, and my account was still frozen.  Two days later, I received a message stating that I had suspicious transactions and they wanted details. Of course, I immediately provided all the necessary documentation. They unlocked my accountâwithout any apology or explanation.  The next day, they blocked my account again. No response from support. Then, I received an email saying my account was blocked and that they *might* send my balance to another account at some point. I replied immediately and provided another account for the transfer.  Of course, nothing arrived, and now I can't even access the app. I can't see my balance, check if my money was sent or receivedânothing. No response from support.  Absolutely not recommended.

Kemal Gozegir,"I used N26 for about 2 years when I was living in Germany. I moved back to Turkey some time ago and wanted to close my account when it became certain that I was not going to return.I am however locked out of the app for some reason, can't login. Not sure if this is because I changed my phone number, I don't have the German number anymore. But the login is done via email so don't think this is the reason. The outcome: I can't close my account because I can't login to the app or their web version (sends an approval to the app). And they keep charging me monthly fees. I only get robots when I try the support chat, or a specialist connects and disappears after asking one question. You get the robot again when you answer.Their customer support is horrible, and the entire process feels like it was designed to stop/discourage people from closing their accounts.

Instead of investigating properly, they have chosen to blame me for their own security failures.N26âs Security Failures:ð´ No Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) â The fraudulent transaction was processed without requiring SMS verification or additional security checks.ð´ Google Pay Breach â I never added my card to Google Pay, yet somehow it was linked and used fraudulently. N26 refuses to provide proof of when and how this happened.ð´ Known Scam, No Protection â I was tricked into a â¬0.40 micro-payment, which then allowed a â¬940 charge without proper verification. Other banks offer chargeback protection, but N26 refuses to investigate.Customer Service? Nonexistent.ð No response after a full week â Despite my urgent fraud complaint, N26 has ignored my requests for a proper investigation.ð No transparency â I asked for a full investigation report, proof of account access, and transaction details. Nothing.ð Ignored for 3 months â I called every week to follow up, yet they never once replied to my emails.

Morino Ravenberg,"I all of a sudden get an email / message stating that my account will be restricted because my residency permit has to be valid for at least a year, keep in mind that this is approximately a week or two after having signed up and gone through the registration process, having topped up my balance and requested a debit card etc etc so essentially already being a fully fledged customer. My message is why For the Love of everything was I NOT told this right from the beginning while registering / signing up??? N26 has made it so that being a customer of theirs was just a waste of time and now they've lost my trust. In theory I can of course simply wait until the aforementioned is the case and then sign up again but I'm very reluctant to do so for obvious reasons. Other than that, communication with customer support itself is abysmal; the only thing or one that helps you is the automated bot response system. It takes hypothetically speaking ages for an actual human being to answer any inquiry you have. So in summation, N26's platform and functionalities as a payment processor and/or digital Bank is good, but the customer service is a one out of five. Just atrocious. No trust or business from me. The benefit is that I don't have to hypothetically worry about that debit card arriving anymore, because it already took hypothetical ages to begin with.","Hey Morino, Thank you for the feedback.

An unhappy client,"My card details have been stolen (I don't know how, could be a n26 data breach?) As such, my n26 card was used to book some holiday in Dubai by some malicious user. Fortunately for me, the transaction was declined due to insufficient funds.I immediately locked my n26 card and contacted n26 for investigation.Almost 3 months later (05th March 2025 as of this writing), no answer from n26, my card is still locked of course.Seeing n26 reply (from 17/03) I also conclude that n26 doesn't read the message. There is no charge back involved, as my n26 card was not debited, I kindly ask n26 to re-read my initial message.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

At this stage, shares and payments are beind exchanged""if you click on EFT it self, it shows different text ""Processing an order can take up to 3 business days""i did the sale 27.02. 9:42, sales was settled on 03.03. so 2 days ago, now it is 05.03 and i have not received any funds.i have contacted support and yesterday they told me that 3 business days are not passed, but it clearly was and today they told me that ""Your case is escalated and you should receive information shortly"", when i asked to be more specific - like when, i got answer that they cannot provide day or or hour, when i receive ""information"". When i asked to talk to someone who can, that was not possible.So basically, i might wait for week or month or forever as there is no ticketing system or smth. They just close the chat if you are 15 minuts idle. Reddit has many these kind of topics, avoid this bank if you plan to invest money.","Hey Egon, Thank you for the review.

Magnus Pereira Livraria Escrib,"Bank FraudDear SirsOn November 21, 2024, I was the victim of an online banking fraud. I received a message, supposedly sent by the Portuguese Post Office, saying that I needed to pay customs fees on products that I had imported. Since I had in fact imported some products from outside the European Economic Community, I decided to make the payment. The link in the message led to a website that imitated that of the Portuguese Post Office. Since the imported products were of low value, the customs fee was also very low: â¬1.99. I made the payment on my laptop using my N26 bank card. I received the code sent by the bank and authorized the payment. I waited for the message that N26 usually sends to make a payment. This message says that I must go to the N26 app on my mobile phone and authorize the payment. This happens with any purchase made on the computer with the N26 card, even those of very low value. So, I felt safe and comfortable using my N26 card for online purchases and payments. This time, the message requesting payment authorization did not arrive. I thought something had gone wrong and tried to pay the customs fee again. Once again, the bank did not ask for payment confirmation. I tried to pay the fee one last time and the bank did not ask for confirmation either. So, I gave up on paying online and went to the post office to pay in person. It was only later, when I checked my N26 account, that I realized I had been the victim of fraud. In the first two requests for payment of the â¬1.99 fee, the bank paid â¬1,000.00 and in the third time, â¬500.00, without me having made the final payment authorization. Note that when the bank sends the authorization code, the message does not refer to the amount being authorized. Therefore, it is clear that N26's security procedures are flawed. Even more so because the bank only accepts debit cards, not credit cards, which makes payment transactions irreversible.The nightmare was not only the loss of money, which may seem like little for a bank, but for me it was my salary for a month of hard work. Worse still was the disregard with which I was treated by the bank when I complained about the unauthorized payments. First, they said that the payment had been made with the physical card, then that I had used a digital wallet (Google Pay). Their effort was to try to discredit my complaint and make me responsible for what had happened. The thing is, I don't have this application installed on my cell phone. In other words, the bank's security system doesn't even know how the payment was made. Then, they said that I authorized the payment, since I used the code that the bank sent. In fact, this happened. However, I authorized the payment of â¬1.99 three times and the bank paid a total of â¬2,500.00. Furthermore, the entire transaction is suspicious, to say the least. No bank would authorize two identical payments in a row (each of â¬1,000.00, in this case) without consulting the customer. This is a global rule for banking security. In other words, N26's security systems are very flawed and the bank does not want to admit its mistakes. I expected N26 to use this incident to improve the protection of its customers. That was not what happened. They simply said that it was my problem, that the bank had nothing to do with it and that I should not insist. In a situation like this, what is there left for a defrauded customer to do? First of all, I began to believe that the bank was complicit or, at the very least,connivance in fraud by omission and that the bank does not care about protecting its customers from the increasingly common and sophisticated frauds that spread across the internet. I intend to close my account with N26 and have not done so yet, simply because I believe that the bank may still go back on this decision that harmed one of its small account holders. I have spoken to other N26 customers, showing them how fragile the security system adopted by the bank is. They are all shocked and feel unprotected. I also intend to report the incident to the German Central Bank. This is what a David can do against a Goliath who simply ignores the damage he has caused.Sincerely,Magnus Pereira","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

BAB,"Really disappointed with N26 customer service. I am a premium client, a service which is supposed to include telephone assistance. However, every time I call I get  an automated robot answer which asks me to open a chat, and then ask a customer service team member to call me instead. This has not been an option despite trying 5 times, and losing hours of chatting.Next, I am getting charges in my account which I do not recognize, I ask for help and to cancel them â¦. And no answer from the N26, 0 reaction and a month later I get them again. I have been unable to get from them an overview of which subscriptions are currently to active, which companies have the ability to book in my account. I did not get it.I was also victim of a scam, and made a money transfer in which I lost my money. Again. No help from N26.Next, I am supposed to be able to withdraw money for free a few times because of the premium I pay. However, I have always been charged commissions. When I ask why, and to please provide me a list of banks in which I can withdraw money without commission as they claim, I did not receive an answer.All of these issues would not have existed with another bank. Therefore, I will leave n26 and never ever come back. I will make sure everyone knows how you work with your clients ð£","Hey, Thank you for the feedback.

Lisa Pisa,"I once gave this bank 5 stars. Now only 2 stars. I don't know what happened in the past 12 months but now it's almost impossible to talk to anyone! I have been trying since January! You wait ages for a human and then the customer support chat cuts out and you have to start all over again. My account has been hacked but you can't even call them unless you have one of the paid cards. And they are not taking my concern seriously. I'm at my wits end!Addit: problem finally resolved and the last staff member was very helpful. Still, one should not have to wait hours at a time to speak to someone, especially in an emergency situation (at the very least there should be a call back option). Also, had I been told that my card was compromised and not my IBAN, I would not have been stressing that the breach would affect my standard direct debit transactions (only the last person told me this. I had previously mentioned -- several times -- that I wasn't sure which piece of information was compromised, and therefore was unsure as to what I should do).Edit: finally got my problem successfully resolved.

When you first take out your loan, you can choose how many months your loan will last, and how much youâll have to pay back each month. With N26 Credit, you can get a personal loan of â¬1,000 to â¬25,000 directly in the N26 app, and pay it back over 12 to 60 months.Your personal loan offer is based on the amount youâd like to borrow, the repayment period, and your credit rating. Depending on these factors, N26 Credit offers effective interest rates starting from 5.11% p.a. You can request and compare your personal loan offers in the N26 app before making a decision.Best Regards, Peter - N26",2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Not Rated,0,2025,Negative

Youcef Alioui,"Support for a terrible bank since the beginning of 2025  I transferred a large amount of 3039.71â¬ on January 14, 2025, from Paysera Lithuanian Bank to my N26 account. Since the transfer is instant between the two banks, I confirmed the success of the transaction, and I have valid documents to prove this up to this point.  I waited a long time for the funds to arrive and tried to contact support several times via the chat box and email, but the responses from support were very slow and completely unhelpful. To make matters worse, I was unable to access the funds in my account for about 30 days!! I also cannot receive any amount in my N26 accountâit seems as if it is closed!! There is no notification clarifying this, and this situation has caused me a lot of distress and anxiety about the funds.  I express my dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided by N26 Bank, and this is absolutely unacceptable for a bank! It is a great manipulation and injustice towards customers. I am giving a one-star rating for the poor financial services provided.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

After asking for information, they still don't give you a timeline or any information on when your funds will be released. Mind you, the account had a turnover of around 3000 eur per year.

christoph schoenbeck,"The most important message to all would-be customers of N26 is: do not pay any monthly fees for 'premium' or any other 'up-grade'. You will not receive any better treatment for your money. And at this point, writing out of a place despair and utter frustration, I strongly suggest you find another bank. Now to my situation: I've been with N26 for many years and started paying for a ""premium"" account a couple years ago because I wanted to have better customer service for when I need help fast. 4 weeks ago I requested a document to be signed by N26. I needed it 4 weeks ago. SInce then I've spent hours in chats and on the phone, explaining my case to one customer service person after the next. No one seems to know what is going on. The document is marked ""priority"" and everyone agrees that it really shouldn't take so long and they all promise that I will get it in the next few days - and every time nothing happens. My colleague, who needed the same document received it signed on the next day, no problem. Only thing is: he's not paying for the premium account. Hence, the word 'premium' means nothing.

Vanessa,"I tried opening a freelance account with N26, which can supposedly be done instantly. I needed it done ASAP, as I needed my IBAN account to be able to set up my new business. However, once I finalized the process, they informed me they needed additional documents to verify my identity and the source of my funds (fine), which would take them 10 business days (pretty long delay for an account that can supposedly be open instantly, and as a matter of fact, while their email said it would take them 10 business days, their app said it would only take them 3). I sent them all the documents and kept waiting. After 5 business days, I tried to reach out to confirm they had received my documents and were working on it. However, they don't have any phone number, and I tried their chats at many different times and days (both the chat for clients and the chat for guests), but they never worked. After 9 business days of waiting around, I sent them another email informing them they better send me my IBAN by the following business day 4PM, or I would find myself another bank. The following day at 3PM, I got an email from them saying they were sorry but they still needed additional information from me to open my account. However, instead of explaining what documents they needed, they simply sent me the same list of documents as in their original email. Bottom line: their ""free"" account for freelancers won't be free. It will cost you ten business days of waiting around just to have to go ahead and change banks. Don't bother. UPDATE: after posting my review on Trustpilot, I emailed N26 a screenshot of the review to let them know how unpleased I was with their ""services"". However, they nonetheless claimed my review wasn't genuine and I had to send Trustpilot a copy of the emails exchanged with N26 so that my review would remain published! Too bad 1 is the worst score I can give N26, they deserve a 0! ADDITIONAL UPDATE: in reply to N26's answer below, believe none of it! I was trying to open a Spanish account and I do qualify! As a matter of fact, I am copying and pasting an email I just received from their signup address: ""Hi Vanessa, We're extremely sorry to hear about your experience with N26 during the onboarding process but please understand that we're facing IT issues at the moment, that's why we couldn't process your documentation in a smoother way. If you'd still want to send your documentation across by replying to this email not later than the 28/02/2025, we'll be happy to process it and continue the onboarding process in order to open your account.

Not Leo,"Where is the 0-star option? 1 star is even too much ... Since N26 allowed a fraudulous withdrawal from a Nigerian payment gateway that works for the Nigerian Embassy to collect money for visa applications, I have been trying to dispute the withdrawal that has let to a negative fund on my account. Since then I have been in contact with the support team, although the term 'support' is far fetched.The support chat is horrible and a waste of your time. Even after the dispute was granted 3 months after the fraud, they closed my account due to the negative fund, even though an support employee messaged me that I did not have to worrry about the warning emails. Now I ended up with a closed account, and I cannot use the app anymore to chat with them and emailing them is even worse. Meanwhile they send an incasso agency after me for the negative fund and I havent received any update since my dispute was granted. None of my questions regarding reopening my account or paying back the money that was in the account before the issue, has been answered.So, concluding: everything is fine .. until you run into a problem and need support. Don't open an account with N26 if you expect a serious bank. They allowed fraudulous transaction without my authorisation although they claim they maintain high security standards. And when in a chat, the employes keep passing you to another colleague, so it can take half a day to be able to get some info, but mostly they cannot help you while repeating standard answers.  It's tedious. Don't open an account, unless you want to lose some money ... or a lot of time.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Arina Kalinina,"I have been a loyal N26 customer since 2018, but my recent experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing.In October 2022, I was supposed to receive a â¬80.00 refund from Yoox (Net-a-Porter). Yoox has confirmed multiple times that the refund was processed, yet the money never appeared in my N26 account. For over two years, I have been in contact with N26, providing all the necessary screenshots and evidence, but the issue remains unresolved.Instead of taking responsibility and investigating properly, N26 has repeatedly sent me generic responses, delayed their replies for months, and even asked me to resend information that I already provided back in 2022. Most recently, after nearly four months of waiting, I was again asked whether I had contacted the merchantâsomething I had clearly done and documented multiple times.My frustration is not with Yoox, but with N26âs complete failure as a bank to track and ensure the refund was credited. As a financial institution, I expected accountability, transparency, and efficiency, but I have experienced the opposite.After six years as a customer, I expected far better service.

Victor Petrichenko,"I would advise against choosing this bank. I have been a client of N26 since October 2018, and for the most part, I was satisfied with their services. At one point, I upgraded to the Smart plan (the lowest tier after free membership) and enjoyed a few benefits, but only rarely.However, I recently faced an unfortunate situation: I was scammed online and needed N26 to provide me with an official transfer confirmation. N26 has been unable to assist me with this request for nearly two weeks. I reached out to customer support multiple times, and while they were very empathetic, they could not expedite the process. It appears that such confirmations are generated by a specific department, and it can take up to five business days. When the 10th business day passed, I still had not received the transfer confirmation I requested.This experience has led me to believe that N26 either has a significant understaffing issue or lacks the capability to generate these confirmations. Both scenarios are unacceptable for a reputable establishment.UPD: The response of N26 doesn't make any sense. I requested the confirmation (a document) and not a chargeback. Again, the response is indicative of the company's level of support, unfortunately.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Ana,"Awful experience!Two reasons why? First, I opened my N26 account in 2022 and they closed it a year later with an awful excuse regarding income. In the meantime, they were consistently asking for my documents in Italy (I'm a legal immigrant), which makes me suspect that they only want Europeans with an account. But I'm not sure about it. They might need do this continuously controlling but so different treatment with my husband who has Italian citizenship. It felt discriminating. The communication was horrible, and suddenly they just closed my account with no valid reason.Second, I'm reaching out to them for over a month (from December 2024 to now) trying to get a document that I need for an Italian procedure and they keep stalling me. It's a simple document regarding my average movements in the account in 2023. It's my right!!! isn't it? First they said they need an ID in order to proceed I sent my ID. Then they need the email related to the account when open and the request to be sent through that email, I was already using that email since the beginning but I sent it again anyway. Then they need me to accept to accept their policy privacy to details treatment through email and I sent the exact phrase they told me in order to proceed. Then finally I received an email that my request was sent to the department and they will send the document I requested as soon as they could. It passed a couple of weeks more and I received the first email again asking for an ID in order to proceed. It's a joke!!!! An incredibly awful experience.

Federico,"Iâve been an N26 customer since 2019, and up until recently, I had no major issues. However, my experience in late 2024 has completely shattered my trust in this bank.In September 2024, I disputed a charge from a fraudulent merchant. The dispute process dragged on for four months, and to my shock, N26 informed me that Mastercard had sided with the fraudulent merchantâeven though I provided clear evidence. Frustrated, I escalated the issue again, and only then did I receive a refund.I thought the ordeal was over, but in November 2024, I was shocked to discover that the same fraudulent merchant had charged me hundreds of eurosâdespite the fact that the original credit card had been blocked since September!When I reached out to N26 to understand how a blocked card could still be charged, I was met with silence. They have yet to provide any explanation. To make matters worse, Iâm unable to report this to the authorities because the card is officially blocked, leaving me in a legal gray area. And to top it all off, N26 is now asking Mastercard for a refund on my behalfâagain.This entire experience highlights N26âs glaring incompetence and inability to safeguard their customersâ money. Their lack of accountability and transparency is alarming. Iâve since taken legal action to protect myself, but I strongly urge others to think twice before trusting this bank with their finances.edit: as evidenced by N26's response, they've completely avoided addressing how a blocked credit card could be used.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Temi,"Iâve been a customer of N26 for some time, and I have never been more frustrated with a bank in my life. Itâs been over a month since my account was closed without any prior notice, and I still have no access to my funds. There has been absolutely no explanation given, and the customer service is completely unresponsive.N26 has a daily transfer limit of â¬5000 for sending funds to currency exchange companies. I was trying to send â¬20,000, so I had to break it up into multiple transactions. After sending two payments, my card was blocked, and N26 initiated a review. The review only took two hours, and my account was unblocked. However, when I tried to make the payment again, my account was blocked once more, even though I was sending funds to the same company that had already been reviewed by N26.Iâve done nothing wrong â I havenât violated any laws or the terms and conditions, yet N26 has decided to withhold my money without providing any valid reason. Iâve even offered to provide proof of income or anything else they might need, but nothing seems to be moving forward.The whole point of having a bank is to feel secure knowing your money is safe, but N26 has completely shattered that trust. With no communication or clarity, I am left in limbo, unable to access my own money. There is no legal justification for this, and I believe theyâre violating my rights.I am now requesting an official response and a resolution, but Iâm not holding my breath. Itâs been over a month and Iâm still waiting. Be cautious before trusting N26 with your funds â this has been an absolute nightmare.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

My account was charged with transactions that I did not authorize, and there is a clear suspicion of fraud. However, when I reached out to N26 for help, my detailed inquiries were completely ignored. There was no response to my concerns, and I have been unable to speak to a real person to resolve the issue.Despite multiple attempts to get assistance, N26 has failed to provide any support or guidance on the matter.

They charged me a subscription fee but never sent me a new card. My app still wants me to add money. Why would I do that if it gives literally no advantage over Wise and keeps glitching like that? Support has become amazingly useless and ineffective. My questions have never been answered even once during last 3 weeks. The chatbot now needs convincing that you need a human agent. The command /human is no longer enough. You have to repeat and press buttons again and again. Only to see the new message that another Muhammad or Sandeep may answer me in 60 minutes. Which they never do. It's a little funny that instead of aswering my questions, they sent me a letter which I never requested confirming some of my details. But once in a while you do run into somebody with active brain like the agent 3 months ago who did clear the glitch of confirming my address.

Anonym,"On December 28, 2024, fraudsters from South Africa made 16 withdrawals from my account within 30 minutes. Loss almost â¬800 plus foreign currency fees. Security system: abysmalJanuary 03 2025I happened to look at my phone one night and saw that a strange amount had been deducted from my account. When I checked my account, I saw that 16 debits had been made from my account during the night, so I blocked my account. Part of the damage has already been reimbursed, but refunds from a second fraudster are still missing. Since the fraudsters are from South Africa, they debited the debits in local currency and N26 charged fees for all of them. How can it be that the bank has no security concept in the event of phishing?

Abrahams,"When N26 was a bank you could get in the UK, I used to use them, but they stopped their UK service due to Brexit. When I moved to Ireland, I started using them again as I had had a good experience with them in the past. Unfortunately, my card details were cloned earlier in the year and it took me over 6 weeks to get my money back, many chasing e-mails and chats, and almost impossible to get a straight answer from them. You can't call them unless you pay for a more expensive service, and there is always issues with the number of people currently needing to talk to them. I frequently did not get a response to my chats. I finally got money back once I raised a formal complaint, but I never received an explanation as to why it had happened. Then last night (28th Dec 24), 2 new fraudulent transactions occurred. This was to the same company that had been used in the past, no authorisation was requested, and the alleged blocked card and CVV number was used. This just goes to show the bank is not safe, and I have no idea how long I am going to have to wait to get my money back again.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

So, CASH26 is my main/only source of money right now.My complaint is:I needed to withdraw some money with my purchase at a Rewe, I accidentally chose âdepositâ instead of withdraw. I realized my mistake once I saw the sum on the cashierâs screen, and explained it to him. He deleted my deposit row, and I bought my stuff without depositing or withdrawing any cash.Now I canât delete this barcode no matter what I do.So far Iâve tried:- clicking delete barcode- closing and reopening the app numerous times.- restarting my phoneNone of these worked. i dont have any other source of money right now. I dont have a card so that or an ATM isnât an option. I have also contacted customer support but they have only told me to ""click the bin symbol"" which is my main problem, that it does not work. It is stuck.This is an urgent issue for me and such an important function not working properly is very sad. I know it is a very specific condition and a bug, but still. I hope it gets resolved soon. Thank you.Update:I have contacted customer support, and after letting them know again that the DELETE icon in fact does NOT work, they have instructed me to:Un-pair my device in the app,Delete the app,Close my device and wait for 2 minutes,Open my device,Reinstall the app,Repair my device.And yeah i mean this is like the hardest reset you can do.. But it did work, so props I guess. Just be careful with re-pairing because you'll need your phone number and your email address you've registered with. I am updating my review from a 3/5 to 4/5.

A â¬727.59 transfer from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et CIE SCA (IBAN: DE83503104000438140301) on December 3 still hasn't been credited to my account, despite N26 claiming there are ""no blocks or issues"" on their end. The sender confirmed that the transfer was successful, but N26 refuses to take responsibility or investigate properly.To make matters worse, I'm now unable to withdraw money from my account, which seems to be blocked without any explanation or notification. Reaching out to customer support has been completely unhelpful.This level of incompetence and lack of accountability is unacceptable from a bank.

Niklas B.,"I got a free business account as a freelancer and upgraded to one of the paid plans to check out the premium features. They have monthly and yearly plans and I picked the monthly plan which is more expensive but I wasnât sure if would need the premium features.After a month I want to downgrade again because itâs an overkill for me, and their customer service tells me I am locked into a 12 month contract, which was not communicated anywhere.At this point Iâm not even sure if this is an issue with their support bot or if thatâs actually their policy. Why the hell would you offer a more expensive âmonthlyâ plan if all plans are yearly?To me this is a dark pattern and leaves a very bitter after taste.","Hey Niklas, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Robert,"A chinese merchant scammed me for 6 identical simultaneous transactions of â¬119 each totaling â¬714. I immediately contacted N26, blocked my card, and started speaking to the customer service. At that moment only 1 of the 6 transactions had fully gone through, the other 5 were still pending. I asked the customer service to block those pending transactions. They refused and guaranteed me that I would get my money back for all 6 fraudulent transactions. Over 3 months of providing details, with monthly reminders, nothing had been returned or any progress made. Often then did not even reply to my messages. Then randomly they send me a message saying that, ""they are running out of time"" and if I do not reply within 2 days they will not be ""able to dispute further"". I again provided them with all the information that I had provided multiple times over the course of 3+ months. Seriously, this is how a professional bank operates??One month later I finally received my refunds.This bank is a complete joke and the customer service is possibly the worse I have ever experienced from a bank.

Daivid Kaufman,"As a legal auditor working for an EU bank, I find it absurd that I cannot open an account with N26 despite my professional background and legal residence in the EU. N26 refuses to accept EU longterm residence ID cards as valid identification, insisting on passports instead. This is not only inconvenient but also an unnecessary barrier for many EU residents who legally live and work within the region using residence permits.In my professional capacity, I understand the importance of compliance and AML measures. However, N26's policies reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of EU regulations and a failure to accommodate the diverse realities of their customer base. My residence ID is recognized across the EU for official purposesâwhy isn't it good enough for N26?This rigidity points to serious issues within their compliance, legal, and AML teams. Their policies are outdated, exclusionary, and undermine their credibility as a modern, digital-first bank. It's clear that the Chief Compliance Officer, MLRO, and legal teams need to reevaluate their approachâor perhaps be replaced by leaders who better understand the EU market and its regulations.For a bank positioning itself as innovative and inclusive, N26 is disappointingly tone-deaf to the needs of EU residents. If they wish to remain competitive, they must modernize their onboarding policies and embrace inclusivity rather than alienating qualified individuals like myself.","Hey, Thank you for your interest in signing up with us - we sincerely appreciate your interest.

But, they are lightyears behind from neobanks even from developing countries, let alone other developed countries. Customer support, particularly on the chat, has disappeared. You wait around for an hour for a rep to come on and to just copy paste information from their FAQ. Their p-account limits, although legally need to be EUR 1,500, are clearly much less, and your transactions getted blocked by the app. When you have a disputed credit card transaction with, let's say amazon, you can't initiate chargebacks with n26. They will through a bunch of forms at you to fill out and in the end tell you it's not their responsibility. So no protection of any kind on that front. Just did a test. I've been trying to reach these people via chat and message for several days now. No response. My gf reached out via her own account, and their chat responded.

Ivan,"After being a customer for 7 years, my account was closed by N26 without any apparent reason, and I lost access to my money. I received but one email from them informing me that my account was being closed and would continue to function normally for 2 months - which did not end up being true. Customer support would immediately terminate my support chats (even after waiting over 3 hours), saying they have no further information, and referring me to the one email I ever received for ""specialized"" support. I never received a reply to any of my emails. I temporarily upgraded to pro for the premium phone support, which ended only being a recording referring me to the online chat support. The internet is full with posts from people with the similar problems spanning many many years now, some waiting up to 9 months to get their money back. What - a - joke. I now have to hire a lawyer.","Hey Ivan, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Daiane Cavalcante,"On November 14, I transferred â¬4,133 from my N26 account to my Trade Republic account. This amount was received by Trade Republic the following day. On November 15, I transferred another â¬54, but this amount has not arrived in my Trade Republic account as of today December 9 nor was paid back to my N26 account.I raised a complaint with Trade Republic, who initially claimed they did not receive the funds and advised me to check with my bank. N26, however, confirmed the payment was processed successfully and suggested the issue lies with Trade Republic.It's been almos a month since this transfer took place and until now the money did not arrive at any of those two accounts and both N26 and Trade Republic are simply exempting themselves from any obligations. N26 customer service is practically non-existent if you have a free account like I do, there so called online chat never works for me and I am already sick and tired of trying to contact then and having no closure to my issue. On the other end, Trade Republic later claimed the issue could be with their holding bank (Citi Bank) and requested the UETR (Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference). I provided the UETR, but Trade Republic has not resolved the issue. They have since requested my bank statement to prove the funds were not refunded to my N26 account.I do not know who's fault that is, I know it is not mine cuz all I did was to make a transfer between my accounts which I have always done but it seems impossible that a so called smart fintech can solve this issue, and I mean the amount of time I have spent on trying to solve this issue on my own is unbelievable. Now my next step is to escalate that in court. Despite multiple follow-ups, nor N26 nor Trade Republic has not provided me with a resolution. So my advice to you is: IF YOU DO NOT WANNA HAVE YOUR MONEY STOLEN BY N26 OR TRADE REPUBLIC AS I DID; STEER CLEAR FROM THOSE PLATFORMS; THE HEADACHE OF SEEN YOUR MONEY VANISHING AND NOT BEING ABLE TO TO ANYTHING AND NOT GET ANY SUPPORT FROM THE SERVICE PROVIDER IS NOT WORTH ITS ""FREE SERVICES PROVIDED"" TRUST ME.PLEASE N26 ""PETER"", DO NOT COME WITH YOU BS EXCUSE ""WE CAN OPEN AN INVESTIGATION"" CUZ I WILL NOT PAY â¬15 FOR YOU TO CHECK YOUR OWN ERROR, IF I TRUSTED YOU MY MONEY AND YOU LOST OR STOLE IT, THE MINIMUN YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO START THIS INVESTIGATION YOURSELF AND PAY BACK THE MONEY I TRUSTED YOU WITH. NOW YOU ALREADY HAVE ALL MY DETAILS PLEASE CHOP-CHOP AND CARRY OUT THIS INVESTIGATION AT YOU OWN COST, UNTIL MY MONEY IS NOT PAID BACK TO MY N26 ACCOUNT OR THE SO AIMED/FINAL DESTINATION I WILL CREATE A COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU ON ALL POSSIBLE CHANELS EVERY; SINGLY DAY!","Hey Daiane,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Dr Ying-Chih Deng-Sommer,"I am writing this review to share my disappointing experience with N26. My account was closed without any prior notice or explanation on 04.December.2024, and it still contains my funds. To make matters worse, all my access to the account has been completely cut off, leaving me unable to view or manage my own money.I have attempted to contact customer service, but the process has been slow and unclear. As of now, I still have not received my funds back or any satisfactory resolution to this issue.While I understand that institutions may have their own policies, this lack of communication and transparency is unacceptable. Closing an account without informing the customer and withholding their funds is not only inconvenient but also distressing.I urge the institution to improve its processes and prioritize clear communication with customers. At the very least, there should be a swift and transparent way for customers to retrieve their funds in such situations.To future users: as of today, I have not received my money back or a clear explanation as to why my account was closed.

SnyatoPro,"So! It's been 8 months since N26 blocked my account and took all the money that was on it! My case is not much different from many similar stories described here - a sudden account block for no reason, a formal ""explanation"" from the N26 that explains nothing. And then - a complete lack of response from the bank. The only time N26 broke the silence was in response to the review I left here (they pretended they wanted to start the process of returning the money, but then disappeared again). But! In any case - they responded to the review and this is already a small achievement. Therefore, leave your stories of money theft by the N26 here and on other platforms! This gives a chance that the bank will finally get in touch! And it will help others not to become its victims - they will manage to leave N26 in time or will not open an account in it! And periodically upgrade your stories so that people can see what they continue - especially if someone managed to get their money back (how soon and which way)! I am currently preparing an application to BaFin and will look for other legal ways to get my money back. Let's see if it will be effective! And one more small notice. I see that most of the reviews about the bank are cases of account blocking and money withdrawal. In the last week alone (Nov. 25 - Dec. 2), I counted 21 such publications on this site. That is, hundreds, if not thousands of robbed clients per year. How is it possible that this bank has not been closed yet, and its management is not prosecuted by law? And this is the bank from Germany, where the sphere of control over financial organizations is one of the strictest in the world! Amazing!!!","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Markus G.,"N26 works well as long as you do standard transfers. As soon as you have an issue with a payment you will be lost in numerous parallel support messages, intransparent statuses and a lack of knowledgable people.I tried to claim money back that was transmitted although the payment process of the shop was breaking up. No answer from the shop on my request to send the money back. So I turned to N26 and hoped that this would be a case for Mastercard to cancel the payment. But instead they would do nothing. Very disappointing. You can't trust that your money is in good hands with N26.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Gian,"They launched a massive marketing campaign promising attractive interest rates if you subscribed to their Metal plan. They got the attention they wanted and signed up plenty of clients. But in less than a year, they've repeatedly slashed the interest rates, conveniently blaming it on the central bank.If you're going to lure people in with high rates and charge for a subscription, the least you could do is lower the subscription fee when you cut the benefits. But noâthey don't care. And when you raise a complaint, their only solution is to cancel your account, which they did without my consent.Their customer service is the worst I've ever encounteredâit's like talking to robots.

Name,"Instant SEPA Costs Money, that alone could end this review. However, I did recently have a bad experience which prompted me to write this. Be careful about using N26! They do not seem to have a good anti-fraud detection system, I exercise immense digital hygiene yet one day I woke up to a -600 charge from a UK betting site. No problem, I thought, just charge it back and that should be it. Well, first off, a bank should block obvious fraud, N26 did not. Second, master card charged me 20 Eur twice (40 total) in fees since the transfers were related to betting. N26 has not been cooperative in returning the lost fees to me, for weeks they haven't responded. I understand it's a challenge to run what is supposed to be a bank, focusing on customers can be overwhelming, however not investing in this aspect will have very obvious consequences, the longer I as a user can not be made to feel like I can continue trusting them, is just time I will simply end up using to tell people to get their funds out of N26 as I do not believe them to be safer than the competition, which by the way allow free SEPA-Instant transfers.EDIT: N26 replied below, showcasing their lack of reading comprehension. Please re-read my review, I had already charged it back successfully. I will now change this review from two starts -> one star.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Nowhere on the appâs interface I followed it stated there would be a â¬10 additional charge. I even checked to make sure this was the case. Two days later â¬30 went off my account. When contacting customer support i was told 2 different things. One person said the one option 1. was â¬0, the other â¬, and there was a disclaimer stating the card also cost â¬10. The second person i spoke two (customer service was interrupted several times do to problems with their site) said it was the way i explained it, 1. 10â¬ and 2. â¬20, but claimed it also showed behind  the â¬20 in () that there is an additional â¬10 fee, which was not the case when I ordered a new card.

Mohamed Elshami,"Case Number: 66833355Iâve been battling with N26 since July 18th, 2024, when they suddenly closed my account without notice, freezing over â¬3,900 of my funds. They asked me to provide documents for the payout, which I immediately sent. However, for months, they ghosted me and failed to provide any updates.On November 6th, I finally received a payout, but it was only â¬576.46âfar less than my account balance. N26 gave no explanation for the missing â¬3,300. Despite my repeated attempts to contact them, Iâve received no satisfactory responses or clarifications.This has caused me severe financial distress. I need the remaining balance urgently, especially to fulfill critical obligations like renewing my residence permit.Iâm exploring legal options to hold N26 accountable and am determined to expose their unethical practices.Has anyone else faced a similar issue with N26? How did you resolve it? Letâs spread awareness about their misconduct and protect others from going through this nightmare.Any advice or support is appreciated!Update as of November 22, 2024Thank you for your response, but your explanation does not address the core issue at hand. While I understand the need for compliance checks as part of banking regulations, my case (Case Number 66833355) raises significant concerns about transparency and fairness.On November 6, 2024, I received a partial payout of â¬576.46, whereas the balance in my account before closure exceeded â¬3,900. I have complied with all your requests, including providing the required documents for the payout process. Despite this, the remaining funds have not been transferred, and I have not received any clear explanation for the shortfall.This situation has caused extreme financial hardship, as I rely on these funds for critical matters, including renewing my residence permit in Germany. I have attached relevant correspondence and documentation to your support channels, yet no resolution has been provided.I urge N26 to address this issue promptly and transfer the remaining balance.

Yar,"I was a customer of N26 bank for 6 years. The first 5 years were carefree. It was my âpocketâ bank for small payments and as a backup card. Over time, I began to rely on it more and more. I set up several of my everyday payments through it, such as television, family mobile phones, and internet services. I also started making more purchases with the N26 card. In general, I became more accustomed to using the bank for a larger volume of transactions, and I kept a larger balance on the account.That was probably my mistake, because after a while, without any explanation, my account was frozen. That was when I first encountered the real level of service at N26, or rather, its complete lack. The chat was answered by bots that couldnât resolve any issue. I didnât get any response to my emails because they said everything was overloaded and it would take longer to reply. This âlongerâ turned out to be several weeks, until I was told that my account was under a standard routine check.This was outrageous, as it meant I lost access to the internet, my phones, and faced many issues because I had come to trust this bank more. Not to mention the funds that were frozen. I couldnât buy flight tickets I had planned for the first days and faced numerous stressful situations. I started looking up reviews about N26 online and was shocked by how many people were facing the same issue as me. You can read about it on Reddit or in Facebook groups like âN26 stole our money.âI strongly advise against keeping in this bank any amount of money you are not prepared to lose. No, actually, I categorically do not recommend holding any amount in N26 that you arenât willing to lose. On top of that, I feel guilty for recommending this bank to my friends over the years. Now, I am telling everyone that this is a real issue.At one point, without explanation, my account was unlocked. I immediately transferred almost all the funds to another bank. A few hours later, my account was locked again. But now Iâm no longer worried, because there was only a small amount left. I still havenât received any explanation for what happened. I filed complaints with BaFin, wrote emails, made calls, and even asked a friend in Berlin to try to find a physical address. When I realized that N26 is just a virtual iceberg, I thanked God ten times that I hadnât kept a larger sum there, like many other people mentioned in their reviews.I am convinced that this bank wonât last much longer. This is the beginning of the end. Be cautious.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

As the Finanzamt was not allowed to write N26, or communicate with them in any other way directly, the only way to clear this issue was by N26 finding that fax. They never did. They never followed up or showed any kind of urgency, despite my calling and emailing them literally every day. As an end result, the issue was never solved and my N26 account was closed. As a result I also received a ""Negative Schufa Auskunft"", preventing me with opening up a standard account with any other online bank. I warned N26 customer service multiple times that this was an issue that needed to be taken seriously as it could have serious consequences for me both personally and financially. Nobody listened, and I am still experiencing the negative effects of those consequences months later. Do better, N26.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

Filip,"Don't use N26 - They are protecting the scammersNo solution from customer support, just ""empathy""I was deducted a subsctiption/transaction from CDFF web page and I reported to N26 that I cancelled subscription and that it was taken illegaly from the the side of CDFF (dating web site). I sent all the evidences and N26 rejected it saying that the date I added in the screenshot is the starting date of subscription, which it wasn't. Then I sent them another evidence, since CDFF changed date in the mean time and they said that I didn't provide evidence and that I can speak with customer support. I spoke with customer support and they kept ignoring my question saying:""I understand your eagerness to retrieve your funds.

Tony Kh,"It's my turn to write a negative comment about N26. My situation is the same as many others here: N26 closed my account, although all transactions were legal, there was a little more than 700 euros left in the account, which the bank never sent to me after I provided an alternative account (my email antonkh69).Based on the systematic and mass nature of such actions on the part of N26, it is quite logical to assume that N26 is deliberately abusing the regulator's requirements in order to appropriate client funds.I have sent a corresponding complaint to BaFin, but I suggest that all victims of what I believe to be N26's fraudulent actions write a class action lawsuit demanding the return of what I believe to be stolen money and compensation for moral damages. In addition, I suggest filing a class action complaint with BaFin, as well as with the Berlin prosecutor's office. To coordinate this, contact me via TG nobody_T1969.I believe that N26, who feels impunity for his actions, should be punished accordingly for the lawlessness that the bank is committing.UPD. In response to the ""automatic"" response template from N26:According to the regulator's requirements, you have the right to check and close accounts, but it is illegal to steal clients' money.","Hey Tony, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

N26 claim they havent received it, so Finanzamt sent them a new letter 30. october. Its now 18.11 and N26 still claim they havent received these letters. In addition to not reply to chat messages, they also stolen my money. They are not allowed to keep the garnishment on my account after they received a request from Finanzamt to remove it, but N26 dont care.

Nesreen Mouti,"My account was suddenly without any prior warning blocked by N26 without any given reason while I was at the airport going on a long vacation, with N26 being my main account containing all my funds.Their customer support refused to provide me on any information on why my account was blocked and told me to check my email and simply ended the chats multiple times. Their email telling me that my account was blocked came a 4 days later. Their email simply stated that I need to provide an alternative account so they would send me my funds and proof of where my funds came from after having this account for around 2 years. I provided this info as instructed and it has been a full month with 0 communication from their side. During this month I sent multiple emails to their support asking when I should expect to receive my money as Im abroad without access to my funds. Their reply to my email was that I should contact the customer support chat, and after 4 days of waiting in their customer support chat queue for hours each day, I was finally connected to a representative who simply told me that this matter must be handled via emails and ended the chat despite me explaining that I was redirected to the chat via the customer support email. They have the worst customer support experience I have ever witnessed from any entity not only banks. Would definitely not recommend this bank after this devastating experience. I don't even care that my account was blocked, but if you are going to terminate my account then at least give me MY money.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Mariya Fuijkschot,"Highly disappointing experience.  For expats that moved to France and hold carte de sejour rather than ID or passport issued in France the process is impossible.  You can not complete set up of the account in the app as there is no option to upload carte decsejour. When contacting customer support as a guest, the replies received from the chat bot are not aligned to the question raised. Waiting time for a human support officer response is over 60 minutes. No automatic notification is coming to alert when customer support employee responds.. if test is the way you handle clients across 20+ territories,  as you claim, you are definitely not a bank to provide quality service. The reply from N26 is factually incorrect and frankly, very dismissive.  Cart de Sejour is an official legal document confirming person's ID and right to work/live in the EU. The N 26 bank's process, however, only accepts ID or Passport issued in France as proof of ID. Meaning that if you have come from the UK and hold UK passport and Carte de Sejour issued by French authorities,  you can not open account with this bank.","Hey, Thank you for your interest in signing up with us - we sincerely appreciate your interest.

Max Pauwels,"Absolutely insane!!!!!!I have an N26 account with more then 10.000 EUR in it. I recently changed my phone, and had to ""pair"" it as my new primary phone, however, a technical error in their app made it impossible to do. I then emailed them, and didn't receive a single reply in in over a month. (Still no reply until this day, and it has been 2 months). I then called them, and they said I should call the next day. I call the next day, and they tell me I should email them. 1 week later, still no response so I call again and then finally get connected to someone that says he can help. He then asks me to confim my phone number, I confirm it and he says he will send me a link to pair my new device after our call. The call ends and GUESS WHAT??The guy typed my phone number wrong!!!! He misspelled one number to be a 9 instead of an 8!!!!I now can't even sign in to the app, can't call or can't do anything!!!!! The only option I have to contact them is their email address: support @n26 .com and NOBODY REPLIES!!!!!!How on earth is something like this possible??It could very well be that someone with the correct phone number now has access to my account and moved all my funds!!!!!Update: its been 4 days since i left this review, and every single day I have been trying to contact them but NOBODY ever replies.

Fernando,"Account Blocked with No Warning, All Funds FrozenIâm in an extremely desperate situation due to N26âs handling of my account. Without any prior warning, N26 blocked my account, freezing all of my funds. This account holds my only financial resources, and now I have no access to my money with no clear answers on why or when it will be resolved.I recently moved to Spain and incurred major expenses for the move, rent, and deposit. I deposited my first salary into my N26 account and provided all the documentation they requested, including my employment contract. Still, my account remains blocked, and Iâm left in limbo with my life on hold.Iâve seen that many others have faced similar issues with N26, which makes me worry deeply about the security of my funds. I feel completely abandoned by N26, with no communication or support to resolve this.If youâre considering N26, please be aware of the serious risk of having your funds frozen without explanation. This has caused immense financial and emotional stress, and Iâm left without any help or timeline for a resolution.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Despite numerous emails, I have received no response from their customer support team.

Max Mrachacz,"Worst Customer Support Ever. No Hotline, Just a chatbot you have to beg to connect youn to a real human. Takes hours for one to join the chat. Had a conversation with one where we exchanged 10 messages and that took 8hours.. absolutely ridiculous!! And the Customer Support Staff apparently has no power to help you whatsoever. You just get ""copy-and-paste""-answers where they don't even reply to what you asked for. And the times they need to do something are crazy. My bank account has been suspended more than a month ago, the reason for the suspension (missed to pay a fine) has been resolved for 10 days now and still nothing from n26. WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A BANK I HAD IN MY LIFE..Edit: and look at the answer they gave me on this review :D ""you can always minimize the chat..."" Yeah thanks, as if I didn't knew. Doesn't better the fact, that what would be a 5min conversation takes more than a day with you. And you get connected to a new staffmember all the time.. and yeah, the messages in the chat stay there, but apparently the staff members cannot read, because even if a question was already posed and answered a few messages above, they keep on asking the same stuff again and again.

DIOGO,"I had the most frustrating experience with N26, and I strongly advise against using their services. After months of waiting to open my account, my first transaction triggered a complete account block and termination. I followed all their terms and conditions to the letter, so I had no idea what went wrong.When I reached out to their support team for an explanation, they insisted that I send a full KYC (Know Your Customer) document just to get any information about the situation. After providing all the requested documentation, their response was shocking. They told me the decision to close my account was final and that I could not appeal it, without offering any clear reason for the termination.This is a complete scam. They are unprofessional, unhelpful, and provide zero transparency. I would never recommend N26 to anyone, as it seems like they block accounts without justification and leave customers stranded with no recourse. Stay away from this so-called ""bank"" at all costs!Their response is an absolute unprofessional! They didn't even read the review to know my account is fully approved! Shame!

Tomomark,"I had a highly disappointing experience with N26. Due to a mistaken garnishment initiated by my creditor, my account was blocked. Although creditor acknowledged the error and provided a withdrawal letter to N26, the bank refused to unblock my account. Instead, they demanded that the creditor explicitly state, ""we made a mistake""âwhich is not a legal requirement for releasing a garnishment in Germany. Both my creditor and I submitted all the necessary documentation, yet N26 kept my account blocked and converted my agreed overdraft into a credit, further complicating the situation.To make matters worse, N26 reactivated an old garnishment without properly checking the case details, despite the fact that it was already resolved. Their support teamâs repeated delays and unwillingness to act, even with clear documentation, caused significant financial hardship.This experience has shown a lack of professionalism, accountability, and understanding of legal requirements from N26. I expected better from a digital bank. I would strongly advise against using their services if you require reliable support or quick problem resolution.","Hey, We apologize for the delay in resolving your garnishment.Our Claims Team diligently processes faxes, emails, and posted documents daily, handling all requests in chronological order.Please rest assured that your case is actively being handled, and you will receive an update via the app messages as soon as possible.Best Regards, Peter - N26 Support",2024-10-16,2024-10-16,1.0,0,2024,Positive
E R,"Be warned, there is no way to file a dispute/chargeback yourself with the N26 app. When you go through âthereâs something wrongâ on a transaction, it only directs you to contact support. So I had to ask N26 support to file the chargeback in August - it was finally successful and I received the refund over 4 months later at the end of December. My transaction on the merchantâs site went through without a shipping charge. The merchant then wanted to charge $100 shipping on a $100 order so I asked for a refund. The merchant claimed they couldn't issue a refund as the transaction was âpendingâ however the money was gone from my account. So I tried to file a dispute to get my money back. N26 support takes a long time to respond via the message area in the app, sometimes up to 3 weeks. Youâre also asked to send screenshots of proof through the N26 app, itâs quite a clunky process. I got my money back finally so itâs resolved now.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us. Our Chargeback team investigatess disputes using the Mastercard Chargeback Guide.

Anita V Euschen,"I have used this bank for 3 years now, and as long as you don't need customer service, all is good. End of last month my card was wrongfully blocked, in the meantime they also received a repealing letter from the creditor - it's been TWO WEEKS of communication and my card is still blocked. I have been waiting hours in the support chat (yesterday two hours until I gave up, nobody answered. Now I have been waiting for over one and a half hour, still no answer) and no result. N26: Easy to block your card, but try to unblock it. I cannot pay my rent, my bills and am lucky I have cash stashed away, as every conspiracy nut will suggest you to do. Never trust banks. Now I also learned that. Day 19 UPDATE: Still no access to my card/account/money. My first contact to N26 about this issue was on Sept. 28.  After 4 hours waiting in the chat the other day and almost another hour to get all answers, the specialist said as a prime member I could call them. I tried the number from the app and the automated voice at the other end welcomed me and said ""currently our phone line is unavailable"". So back to the chat yesterday. Less than an hour wait, only to find out what I hear every time, ""Your case has been escalated to the relevant team and I personally prioritised your case"". Feels good, but since I hear this every time, I know it means nothing. Yesterday I ask them again if they received the repealing letter. It had been faxed on Friday and Tuesday again by the kind and patient creditor (who also just rolls their eyes when I tell them what I go through) to two different fax numbers of N26 (and also by letter, which should also arrive now or did arrive). The N26 specialist could not tell me if the faxes had arrived. Another specialist before said they could not locate the fax. And this one was not able to check if it arrived. The other day I offered them office management tips, but then specialist Pavlos left the chat. Did I sound frustrated? So last chat yesterday evening and yes: He ""prioritised my case personally"" and, yes! ""Escalated it to the relevant team""! Like all of them. And without result. No reply to my emails, no phone number to call (I tried several), and useless chat support. I am definitely looking for another bank and suggest the same to friends and family who I all recommended this bank in the past. Nobody can afford these kind of problems. Day 25 UPDATE: I contact N26 ""support chat"" every second day. Nothing has changed. They dare to say ""...I can see that you have already sent us the fax number of the letter and that's make it much easier for us to solve this issue as fast as possible!However, rest assure that I will escalate this to my manager right now and prioritised it and i'll handle this for you ASAP.""With escalation to the relevant team every second day I think my case must be with God himself now! The first fax was sent 4. Oct, meaning 19 days ago. Another fax followed a few days later and also a letter was sent. All the reviews don't help me with my case, this bank does not care. But I hope readers will refrain from using this bank while I also recommend all my friends and family, that I previously referred to this bank - to close their accounts with N26. LAST EDIT: it took them ONE MONTH to solve my issue. They received the repealing letter FOUR times from my creditor: three times by fax and one letter. They simply could not find them and thus not process my case. The drama ended after one whole month, when they finally found the 3 weeks old fax and unblocked my card. Careful with this bank!! The customer support is:ZERO. And I would give zero stars if I could.","Hey Anita,Thanks for taking the time to send us your feedback.

Ric,"The app works well and they provide many services for free which is great. However, I paid for a Metal subscription plan to get the advertised benefits which are good but: you don't get chat priority, only phone priority. I had a chat open from Oct 5th and got an answer after 5 days only after I asked if anybody was going to answer. Then, mid chat, the conversation was dropped and after several hours, nobody else was assigned to it (this is unacceptable regardless of having a paid support plan or not). The phone priority is just if you call them on a German number from your registered number on your profile so: unless you have a plan that includes German numbers, you pay a lot of money to call them and you cannot use another n* (hope to never lose your phone). They offer the ability to trade stocks but they provide no option at all to generate reports of stock transactions (which is a basic function all other main banks or brokers provide). I called them a few times about needing a report for tax purposes, finally I was assured I would get one every 3 months and now that I got it, it only provides a snapshot of the holdings as of 30 Sept which is not what you need to declare/pay your capital gains taxes. Again, this is a basic information main banks and brokers provide their customers and also allow their customers to generate on demand.","Hey, Thank you for the feedback.

Very sad.Edit after N26 reply: I worked for banks, and I understand the regulation it was the manner my query was handled that was so disappointing. The first representative gave me no answer at all and returned me to the bot the second said we can't help you wait for the email goodbye then ended the chat.

Vadym,"My experience with N26 has been nothing short of a disaster. Tomorrow marks 5 months since my account was deleted without any explanation. They simply closed my bank account, which had a remaining balance of â¬1413, and requested certain documents, which I promptly provided.In two separate messages, they assured me that they would return my funds and asked for my bank statement and details for the transfer. Naturally, I provided everything they requested, but then they completely stopped responding.I have repeatedly tried to contact them through chat support and email. They either do not respond at all or make empty promises that they will expedite the process. In short, N26 is outright lying in their responses, claiming they will speed up the process, yet nothing changes. This is not just poor service; it is blatant dishonesty and an attempt to evade responsibility.I would like to emphasize that they have been withholding my money for 5 months without any dialogue â this is an unimaginable violation of my rights.If you are considering using N26, be cautious. This is a bank that deletes accounts without explanation, makes false promises about returning funds, and then goes silent when you comply with their requests. No one should have to deal with such unprofessional behavior, especially when it comes to their own money.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Despite briefly reopening the account, it was blocked again, and it took 96 hours before I received any explanation. This lack of communication and transparency is unacceptable.N26âs actions violated Article 88 of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which requires immediate notification of account blocks. Additionally, they infringed on my rights under Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), by restricting my access to my own funds without valid justification.This situation has caused me significant financial harm, including the inability to pay my employeesâ salaries and settle business obligations, as well as personal inconvenience with my accommodation.I demand that N26 immediately unblock my account and provide compensation for the damages caused.

Marcel,"Unfortunately my experience with N26 is terrible. I have opened an account and within a few months without any prior notice they freezed it. After a big discussion with unacceptable delays from the helpdesk they gave everything free again and all good I thought.Only three months later I got a notice that N26 cancelled my account. I have proven that I havenât done anything wrong. The fact is now that N26 is UNREACHABLE for months! They are hijacking my money. Nothing helps. I am not a criminal N26! Please give me back my money! Since your helpdesk is unreachable, you blocked my login, the only thing I demand is giving back my OWN money. I have sent you 20 (!) messages, just no reply, nothingâ¦ this is unbelievable.As a result N26 replied on my review. Thanks for redirecting me to a website of N26. This is information I already have read before, so nothing news here. The only thing I would appreciate is to give me my money back. As said before, I am not a criminal, I have done nothing wrong, N26 is just hijacking the full amount of my account...! The initial review is even stronger now. Vague replies, or not a reply at all from N26. They just close an account without prior notice. It would help that you would communicate 100% secure and correct, which is clearly not the case at all. This remains unbelievable and unacceptable. Come on N26, we live in 2024, you could do much better!!Update: 4-10-2024: NONE. Even no reply on several other messages. Please N26, let me know when to recover my (own) money.Update 11-10-2024: And yet not even a sign of life at N26. Unfortunately no feed back. Several messages without even a single reply. For the review here at trustpilot they asked me to clarify my filenumber and bankaccountnumber. I provided everything, just everything. And still N26 is just hijacking my money. Please N26, just send me a message what is going on. This is totally unacceptable and even ridiculous...!Update 1-11-2024: even now: no reaction at all!! N26 is hijacking my money for several months now, doesn't respond to ANY of my messages. I have had a (general) chat in their helpdesk affair, and after a wait of 51 minutes (!), eventually the person informed me that he couldn't do anything for me and that I have to write N26 (AGAIN) with my request. He couldn't see anything wrong with me, and that he couldn't reach my files.N26, it is getting worse, you should be ashamed of yourself. It al seems flowers and bees at your website.

I am very disappointed - Now another issue is that the new ATMâs in NL which are singularly managed by a company (not the banks) refuses n26 cards .. i try to reach n26 but the chat as well as the âpriority hotlineâ is not reaching anyone no one picks up so after 2 failed attempts i try again to hear the machine voice say they are unreachableâ¦ :(((,"Hey Jasper,Thanks for leaving your feedback.We are sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support.

Yves Bouchez,"My reply to N26 comment below :You obviously donât even read my post : N26 never got round to file the chargeback . Over more than 4 months I had to chase updates . Twice it was obviously not done or the wrong way and I was asked to resubmit everything.So why do you reply with in case the chargeback  had been declined a link where I can file a complaint : Fat chance to even getting the changeback rejected when you never deal with it in first place. To add insult to injury.. yesterday received a mail asking if I still had the object in possession.. 5 months after I received it when that thing that once was  a television had baby cockroaches crawling in it : 5 months later I get the first message from N26 about the chargeback . strangely enough the same day I requested the downgrade , what a coincidence! Where years ago I first joined N26 in 2019 and went âmetalâ premium it was a breath of fresh air in the conventional banking industry. This till 4 months ago I for the very first time initiated a chargeback when I got scammed on Wallapop and Wallapop ruled in favour of the scammer ( as they do ). Went through the whole procedure of facilitating all the proof etc .. when 3 months later  as I heard nothing from N26  I sent a message via the ( supposed to be priority hotline we pay 16,95 / month for ) application. Several weeks later still no answer . Called hotline .. they checked and acknowledged that they treated the claim incorrectly as an unauthorised transaction and not as what I made claim out for .. Can I please resubmit the details and they would speed up the process: 6 weeks later I again inquired by message.. no reply .. Called them yesterday and the specialists would contact me within 48 hours with update / status This morning.. I get a mail asking me to submit once again all the details / pictures etc .This is taking the biscuit : As result , today Iâm no longer metal member and people should think twice to become or continue to be metal members . I spoke to a friend I â recommended â N26 years ago and told him about my decision: He actually closed N26 several months ago as he too was particularly disappointed with N26 .

Sunny Fassler,"I'm about to lose it with you, N26. Your service and level of help are beyond appalling. It's been 12 DAYS since I made a transfer that's now vanished into thin air. You claim it's been completed on your end, but the receiver's bank says they haven't seen a damn thing. How the hell does that work?I've explained over and over that this transfer was crucial for a lease agreement and document signings. I've already made two transfers to this receiver from N26 without issues before. But no, you had to screw this one up royally.Now, thanks to your mind-blowing incompetence, the deadline for the lease agreement and signing has come and gone. I'm risking losing the entire investment because you can't get your act together for a simple wire transfer.But do you care? Of course not. You keep coming up with shady excuses and what I can only assume are flat-out lies. ""We're aware of the problem,"" you say. ""Our senior team is on it,"" you claim. Yet here I am, still waiting for a transfer confirmation I requested over a week ago. A transfer confirmation for an international wire transfer should take 3 days tops. Not 4, not 6, and certainly not 12!Every time I ask for an update, you feed me another lame excuse. It makes me wonder - do you lie to all your customers, or am I just special?You know all of this by now. I've been repeating myself like a broken record for the last twelve days. It's beyond a joke at this point. It's a complete failure of everything a bank should be.To anyone considering N26: Run. Run far away. Unless you enjoy the thrill of wondering where your money might end up, or the excitement of talking to a brick wall disguised as customer service.

CSH,"While the N26 app has a sleek, modern design for basic banking needs, the overall service is severely lacking. Customer support is unprofessional, providing conflicting and often vague answers that fail to address specific issues.

I asked to have my case escalated, but they do not do that and you can only interact with the same incompetent people on email, chat or social media.

The process for filing a dispute for goods ordered online depends on the circumstance. Hereâs a breakdown of the most common scenarios:You ordered goods online but never received them, and the merchant provided an expected delivery date First, youâll need to wait until the estimated delivery date has passed. If the goods donât arrive within this timeframe, you can dispute the transaction from the date you expected to receive the goods. Mastercardâs chargeback guidelines state that you must file the dispute within 120 days of the anticipated delivery date.You ordered goods online but never received them, and you were never provided with an expected delivery date  In this scenario, Mastercardâs chargeback guidelines allow you to file a dispute 30 days after the transaction date, kicking off a 120-day window in which the filing must take place. You received a delivery, but it doesnât correspond with what you ordered  Here, you may file the dispute right away, provided you aren't able to resolve the issue with the merchant. You have 120 days from the date you received the goods.Best Regards, Peter- N26 Support",2024-09-11,2024-09-11,1.0,0,2024,Negative

Emily,"I've been an N26 customer for about six years now. For day to day expenses and in particular travel I find them great. No fees to use my card on the other side of the world, what's not to love?However my card was recently pirated and all went downhill. I received a notification of a purchase which I did not make and promptly blocked the card to prevent further damage. Why did I not have to validate the purchase in the app like everything else I will never know.It's been one month and I see no resolution in the near future. I followed the instructions on their website but they don't work - clicking on 'there's a problem' only takes me to the home page and not to the declaration of fraudulent behavior as mentioned in their instructions. Using the chat I was provided with a form to fill out and told to send it via the secure messaging system except I can't send a message via the secure system only receive. After another chat conversation they told me to just send by email (don't worry, no security concerns they said...). Received an auto email saying it'll take two days to get back to me. Two days later another message saying they are overwhelmed with messages and it will take a bit longer. That was nearly one month ago. I'm still out of pocket, and with no functioning bank card. If I ever get my money back I think it will be time to close the account. A friend had the same issue with another bank recently - was able to do everything seamlessly in the app, had the money refunded to her account immediately, with a warning that it would be refunded pending the investigation which took a total of 5 days.There's a feeling of helplessness knowing your details have been stolen and the response from N26 is in no way comforting, if anything only exasperating the situation.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Laura,"The worst service ever. I opened account, didnât like the whole concept, not user-friendly at all, and wanted to close account straight away. They didnât let me close the account. Okay, I just deleted the app then, but they kept sending me e-mails for months after and somehow got me into debt, even though I never even used their services! I never even ordered a card or put any money there. I just used the app for 5 min. And now they are threatening me to get debt collectors after me if I donât pay them 21.42 euros. Very sad and desperate move, probably thatâs how they make moneyâ¦ Avoid them!","Hey Laura, Thanks for the review. It sounds like you may have opened a premium account that has a monthly fee.

Tibor Jona,"They are not really a bank, its more like a current account with a functional app. The moment you need to do more than just send money from A to B it tends to get complicated. Also they tend to misrepresent some features advertised as benefits - like travel insurance. After having my luggage lost i spent some two months trying to claim the alleged benefit from the company. i exchanged endless emails and in each new one the company extended the list of documents required for claiming the benefit. at the end of this ordeal they requested a proof that my journey started from my home. this was round 5 or 6 of themexpanding the list of required proofs. what leaving for airport from domicile adress had to do with lufthansa loosing my luggage is beyond me.  then i realized this particular request is actually a catch 22 - e.g. i showed them an sms from my mobile privider showing that i entered the country where the airport was located some 2 hours before the flight and the company did not want to accept that as proof because my name and telephone number where not visible in the sms - they basically wanted me to provide something that doesnt exist because no mobile company in this world sends personalized sms messages announcing beginning of roaming charges. god knows what would have been the next thing they asked.  and the scary thing is that they were ready to go through all that for a legitimate claim of skme 400â¬ for a pair of pants, a shirt, a pair of underwear, socks, a par of shoes and a sweater.bottom line - for in & out basic banking they are fine and app works good (also app is in english which in germany is a world wonder) but anything else including alleged benefits - tought luck.","Hey Tibor,Thanks for sharing your feedback.The travel insurance in our premium accounts is provided by Allianz and they are the ones dealing with your claim.

Bekkouch,"I travel abroad a lot, so i thought that N26 is a good fit for my needs. anyhow I was satisfied with the security of the app every payment i made was double checked through the app and everything was well. One day in May, i wake up with my account to 0 !! someone was able to use my card from the US on walmart/microsoft/fb pay. i live in europe so this happened at around 4 AM. I was shocked at why and how is this possible. I file a complaint and it took 3 months and many reminders from me to get paid back by them. Ok no problem, fast forward to one week ago, the companies where the fraud happened and to which I also sent complaints explaining that i don't even live in the US, decided to reimburse me and what did N26 do ? took the money back !!!!! I'm trying to contact them since 23/08 and they keep ghosting me on the live chat. and asking me to fill my account through system messages. I'm at loss of words. so much for neobanks being better at client relationships than traditionnal banks. You lose your money because of their incompetence to secure the accounts and when you get your money back they tax it from you !!

For a year, I was unable to get in touch with them as they didnât respond to my emails, even though the bank is holding more than 100,000 euros of my money. On June 3rd, I was informed that you were expecting documents and information related to my new account in order to process the transfer, which I need to provide to N26.It has been more than two months since then, and I have sent more than six emails to the bank, but none of them have been answered. To be precise, they only responded to one email in which I didnât attach any documents, asking me to send the documents, which I have done at least five times. But there has been no response, no feedback from the bank. My money has also not been transferred to my account. I would like an explanation from N26.

Mel.,"I have been a customer for several years. Up until maybe a year ago I thought the app and overall service had some flaws but were getting better and better. unfortunately now they are getting worse and worse.First it was a disaster when they introduced a chatbot that didn't understand anything and prevented from reaching out to customer service. Then I signed up for their most expensive plan because they promised 4% interest per year, but only after a few months they decided to lower this to 3%. Intransparent advertising to say the least.They also sell an insurance package with the Metal plan, but do not seem to know anything about the terms of the insurance. They just tell you to go ask Allianz.The app shows ATMs where one is supposed to have free withdrawals but it is not reliable. When I said that I discovered a surprise charge on my statement they  blamed it on the third party data provider and offered no assistance or reimbursement. Last but not least, I recently wanted to contest a direct debit because the merchant made a mistake in the amount charged and told me they could not correct the invoice unless the payment was cancelled and re-issued, which would require me to contest the charge. N26 did not let me contest the direct debit, so I was not refunded and I could not get the correct invoice from the merchant.It goes without saying, that I will not renew my subscription to a paid plan, and I do not recommend it to others.Edit in response to the comment received from N26: Giving anything less than one year (subscription duration I signed up for) at the advertised conditions is not ""fair"". It is misleading advertising.Best regards.","Hey Mel, Thank you for the feedback on our premium offer. The 4% offer will decrease from October 1st to 3%, we'll always give a fair amount of time when there is a change. Best Regards, Peter, N26 Support",2024-08-08,2024-08-08,Not Rated,0,2024,Positive

Jeremy sandle,I was invited by N26 to open a joint account. After a lengthy process it was set up with my partner receiving confirmation that he could access the joint account. I assumed that my account had become a joint account. I was wrong but that was not clear! On getting access to the joint account my partners account became invisible and unknown to him his card had become linked to the ânewâ joint account which had no funds in it. His own card was no longer showing on the bank app. Luckily he has other banks to access funds.The first chat agent Mohammed looked into the account and reported no issues! On reminding him about the problems he took another 10 minutes handed the case to someone else. Then that person asked last 4 digits of card before terminating the chat.So more wasted time and next agent comes on. Absolute NIGHTMARE N26 response below was to propose yet another chat! We have a life as well as being at the beck and call of N26. This morning we started a new chat. We discovered that we have to have a sole account which n26 call a Main account in order to have a joint account. Also that we are supposed to be able to link our debit cards to either the Main account or the joint account. But to do this you need to understand what Spaces means! So mind bogglingly complicated.,"Hey Jeremy, Thank you for the review. Please ask your partner to open a live chat so we can check their account.

This is a basic features that a Bank should support. It supported to filter the transactions but no option to export them to pdf. 2. Can't add a Nick name/hint for the contacts with multiple IBANs. Like N26 spaces, individuals have multiple accounts with same name and different IBAN. No way to identity them as we can not add a nick name to the contacts. Again basic feature missing from traditional banks. 3. Income sorter is based on the amount not on salary or transaction details. Horrible, everytime I have incoming transaction bigger than this amount, it will be sorted, even of it is not income. Worst part is No option to disable it temporarily when expecting some similar transaction. Re enabling looses all settings.","Hey Raghavendra, Thanks for taking the time to leave us your feedback.

Minh Nguyen,"I recently had a frustrating experience with N26's customer service regarding my taxed shares. As a German resident, I know that we are tax-free up to â¬1,000 for capital income. Despite adding my tax number to my account, I was still charged taxes incorrectly. When I reached out to customer service, the representative initially provided inaccurate information, claiming my allowance was used up by interest from my savings account, which was not true as I did not gain any interest.After some back and forth, the representative admitted to looking at the wrong tab and escalated my issue for further investigation. Additionally, I have a travel insurance claim through my N26 Metal account that has been pending for over two months with no progress. I was directed to contact Allianz directly, as N26's customer service couldn't provide any further information.While the representative was not polite and eventually escalated my issue, the overall experience was disappointing. It took too long to address my concerns, and the initial misinformation added unnecessary frustration. N26 needs to improve their customer service training and ensure they provide accurate and timely information to their customers.","Hey Minh, Thank you for the review.

Ricky,"So far I was happy with N26. Infact moved my salary account to them too.  However, I made an ETF transaction and a glitch or a bug replicated that transaction 3 times. Thats alright it can happen, but the disaster is the customer service. First the chat bot is highly inefficient, dumb and a time waste. Then the chat human assistants just keep copying and pasting the same long texts without actually helping or giving any real feedback. After 2 weeks they responded saying I should just sell the transaction seeing that I made a profit. That also shows laziness in reviewing the case because I actually lost money and didnt make a profit. One of the replicated transaction is ""appearing"" as profit. So even the 2 weeks delayed response was EXTREMELY incompetent, and zero feedback provided. Once this is resolved, definitely moving to Revolut, only because much better customer service compared to N26.","Hey,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with your ETF transactions.Our dedicated team will be in touch with you via messages in the app in order to solve this issue, and we kindly ask you to update us once you can, so we can provide you with further assistance.

Tom Arrell,"Absolutely rubbish service. Their customer support is incompetent, and when you have an issue with your account, it takes them months to resolve. Do not put keep your money with them, and if you do, don't think it won't happen to you. That's exactly what I thought.","Hey Tom,A garnishment is an order coming from a Court or from Public Entities, directed to seize the funds from a customer's account to satisfy a debt owed by a debtor  to a creditor. As a consequence, N26 has the legal obligation to retain the funds in your account to be later transferred to the creditor (public entity or to the account specified by the court).We recommend that you contact a lawyer to understand how to proceed. N26, as a third party, cannot take any action in this regard, as we are legally obligated to apply the fundsâ seizure till the repealing of the garnishment or to transfer them, according to the court decision or the public entity request. Any clarification needed about the garnishment or communication must be done with the creditor directly.The transfer of the funds is executed at different times depending on the type of creditor who has requested the garnishment. Normally it is within 60 days (Public Debt Collector or Tax Office) and within 20 days after receival of payment order from the court. The amount will be transferred directly to the creditor specified by the judge in the payment order. Best Regards, Peter - N26 Support",2024-07-17,2024-07-17,Not Rated,0,2024,Positive

Marc,"App and service are not bad. Charges for services other banks offer for free. But the really poor experience is if you have any issue with a credit card payment. They need months and months to work on it. What others resolve for you within a week or two. I have a dispute open for two months now and still nothing. Never use their credit card for online purchases.EDIT: their response to this is non-sense. It was not declined, they are still working on it, 2 months later. N26 customer support, as this response shows, is just VERY BAD. Hope that you never need any of their staff to work on anything.

Zsolt Papp,"I am writing this review out of sheer frustration and disappointment with N26's customer service and communication. I have tried multiple times to open an account with N26, but I keep encountering issues without any clear explanation or support from their team.Last year, I attempted to register but faced an error in the final step. Recently, after moving to Austria and needing a new euro-based account, I tried again but encountered the same issue. Despite having a proper Austrian address and official documentation to prove my residency in Vienna, I am still unable to open an account.I contacted the Austrian customer service team, who informed me that they could not assist me for legal reasons and abruptly ended the chat without providing a detailed explanation. I then reached out to the international customer service team and, despite waiting for a response, I have received no communication whatsoever.As an EU citizen with an average job and no criminal record, I believe there must be a misunderstanding. I am seeking clarification and assistance but am met with silence. The lack of communication and support is extremely frustrating and unacceptable for a bank that prides itself on being customer-friendly and technologically advanced.I hope this review prompts N26 to improve their customer service and address my issue promptly. I AM STILL INTERESTED IN OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH N26, BUT I NEED PROPER GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT TO DO SO.","Hey, Thank you for your interest in signing up with us - we sincerely appreciate your interest.

yusuf sefa Ã¶zhan,"On 06.06.2024, I received a notification for a transaction made and refunded in foreign currency. As I was sure it was not belonging to me, I reported it and started a chat (as phone call or hotline is not available for standard subscription).After quickly wrote down and proceeded with chatbot, I was made waiting in the chat for a human being to connect. 3 minutes, before the representor connected, 14 consecutive transactions made varying between 100 and 200 $ (about 2400 EUR in total). I had to terminate my card and explained it to the person connected 4 minutes later. I followed the instructions and initiated cashback procedure as required.At that moment, all those transactions were still in ""being processed"" status after my notice. The status turned to ""processed"" a day after.An important issue here is that none of these transactions required payment confirmation, which I receive normally for my smaller amount transactions. According to PSD2 (Directive (EU) 2015/2366), it mandates Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to increase security for electronic payments. The transaction amount thresholds for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) are explicitly mentioned in the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under PSD2 and are directly applicable in Germany through the Payment Services Supervision Act (ZAG). These regulations ensure that transactions over specific amounts, such as â¬30 for general payments and â¬50 for contactless payments, require SCA to enhance security and reduce fraud.Furthermore, under PSD2, which has been transposed into German law, banks are required to resolve disputes and unauthorized transactions promptly. According to Article 71 of PSD2, payment service providers must investigate and resolve disputes within 15 business days. If the bank needs more time, it must inform you of the delay and provide a final response within 35 business days.In my case, it has been 25 working days and except automatic generic responses, I had no luck with seeing neither a reasoning for it exceeded 15 day or a response other than automatically generated ones.My personal experience so far points out that n26 is lacking of customer support and of security for bank card use.Nevertheless, I will wait 10 working days before I proceed with legal complaints as it has not been 35 days yet.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Christopher Toska,"Stay away!The support is nonexistent and instead everything is done by barely working machines.In case you ever lose access to your Bank account you can kiss your funds goodbye for good.I was fortunate enough that those problems occured before the first payments from my clients went in!edit: Sadly I can't reply to your comment directly, so i have to add it this way.I had contact to your customer support - thrice in total, while it took between 5 and 20(!!!) messages to your damn chatbot until that damn thing finally let me through to them.My problem was that the app apparently skipped some notification that even after the first login, following the verification process the account wasn't ready yet. This led to me trying to login. After all I had gotten a mail stating the ID verification was done.Trying to login in the app presented itself like this:entering the password, followed by the app loading, showing something that looked like the inside of my account would be loaded right now, followed by a revert to the password screen.this could be repeated infinitely and there was no notification whatsoever that there was any problem at all!After trying it about 10 times with no success and without any error ever(!) i contacted your support, noting that there was only a bot(!).After talking to this rudimentary, coming straight form the early 2000nds i finally got through to your first customer support agent.That one genuinely seemed like he was trying to help, as he told me all the steps to troubleshoot this.Those steps i had already tried though - all of them that is, as those werew the most generic troubleshooting steps for any app.Finally we agreed about the one thing i hadn't done yet - uninstalling the app, shutting my phone off and waiting more than 5 minutes before retrying, so this chat ended.Naturally, as it was clear to me that the problem was not on my end, it didnt work.So i got back to customert service.This time the bot annoyed the hell out of me and reiterated the same 2-3 questions about 5 times to me until he finally asked whether i wanted a human.The next two and final times I believe it was always the same person, as was his name and demeanor.He disregarded conmpletely - both times - that this was not the first time i had contacted them. He disregarded any steps i had undertaken before.So it was the same *fun* all over again - thrice.With one exception: the first guy genuinely seemed he was trying to help, saying things like he'll ask and i should wait for as long - while the second just said i should wait and it would fix itself.My wife worked in callcenters and told me these are standard steps read from the generic instructions they get when they work for different companies at the same time at their callcenter.This fits with my observation that those agents had not even the slightest clue what was going on in the background.Why didn't they know that my account wasn't yet ready otherwise?It gets even better the following day.After the fabulous second support guy told me just wait until the next guy without trying it again before the next morning i did just that. The next day i woke up, tried and then once again tried to reinstall the app - didnt work.then i finally gave up hope and went to a proper bank to make my business account, as i desperately need it already. while waiting at the bank an email came: n26 told me i could get started - something that according to the last mail shuold have been the case already. this time the behaviour changed though: it couldnt repeat the password loop because the verification sms wasnt received anymore!!hoem and back to the fabulous support!once again: the same idiotic steps after the same senseless reiteration of the whole ordeal, to get the same idiotic textbook callcenter responses.the deduction of your agent: it's because of my mobile provider, but to be sure he also reset my ID verification, so i had to go through this process again.After he did that he asked me to dio it while he was stil in and was dumbfounded that SMS still didnt come.no wonder after he had asked me like 5 times during the conversatrion if i had changed my number, nationaility name or passport in the 24hours since i last did that.by the way: your ID verification process is the worst i have ever seen. i had to try the full 3 times per successful attempt and it took at least 5 minutes each time.linkedin for comparison took like 30 seconds and even scanned the RFID of my passport.linkedin vs a ""bank"".in the end the problem resolved itself, something i tried to alleviate by getting to your customer support agents in the first place.i had suspected that your system had blacklisted me and since they clearly werent able to check it makes the state of your customer ""support"" all too clear.make of that as you will, i stand by my review :)","Hey Christopher, Thanks for your feedback.

Wizy Wizy,"If there is zero star, I would drop zero star for this joke of an online bank. Here is why.I opened an account  on the 13th of March 2024. Then I received 5k Euros from my work, Then noticed the App has stopped functioning and I couldnât process a transfer or receive any money into the account, i ordered and payed for an ATM card and It never arrived till date. I tried contacting the customer support via the online chat asking why is my account frozen for no reason, they kept on telling me, they canât help with the matter, I should check my email for information and for four days there was no email whatsoever. After back and forth for 4 days, I finally received an email from them telling me they suspended my account because of the money that came in and they are doing routine anti money laundering checks ( which I am totally fine with as itâs very necessary). The they asked me to provide more supporting documents.I provided all the documents they asked of me on the same day via the email they provided. I didnât hear anything else from them for more than 2 months even though I kept following up asking for updates, I kept on trying to get some update from the live chat as all my email werenât getting any response at all, of course the live chat kept closing the chat saying they donât have any further information about my account. -Three months has gone, Iâve been stranded, frustrated and devastated as they lock my money from my work, but they donât care ofcourse, I started reading online reviews and saw many other customers complaining about the similar of not exact experiences with M26, how N26 blocked their account and keep their money without any explanations, until they started fighting legally or contacting BAFIN, N26 seems to be playing ignorance until you give up and let them made away with your money. -Long story short, itâs been over 3 months since they frozen my account, so i received an email from them 3 weeks ago saying they have decided to CANCEL MY ACCOUNT for good, which Iâm totally fine with because theyâre the worst banking experience Iâve ever had in my entire life. ( Reason for cancellation is because I broke their so called terms and conditions which I have no idea what theyâre talking about ) because I sure didnât know that receiving â¬5k in an account that has a deposit limit that exceeded over â¬100k breeches the terms and conditions. But heyâ itâs kind of comforting knowing that Iâm not the only victim to their unprofessionalism and insubordination after reading stories from lots of other victim customers of theirs.-So I asked them about my fund in the account which they mentioned nothing about refunding it back to me, but from my research, I learnt that itâs illegal for them to keep your fund after they close your account if your account is not associated with any fraud (which my account is completely not). -So I provided them with my other account in my  name, then they asked me to provide proof of address to support my account as the address in my account was my old address because I moved into a new home recently. -I provided them the new proof of address via the email they provided, then 3 business days passed and I didnât hear anything from them, not even âhey we received your documentsâ.-So I decided to follow them up again via email and live chat asking them to acknowledge the receipt of my documents and to give me a timeline when Iâll be getting my refund into the account I provided, and finally I got an email response from them telling me they have received the documents and are processing the issue. Then went on to say â We can assure you that your case will be processed and any further updates relating to your case will be given to you.Once there is an update we will reach out to vou.âPlease be aware that providing documentation to the Bank is not confirmation or a guarantee that the payout of the funds will be possibleâ. N26 Bank adheres to the strict rules and regulatory guidelines required of as a fully licensed bank.N26 Customer Service has no additional information on this subject at present.-Well thatâs just that so far, itâs been over 3 weeks now since this email response that I forced out of them came around, since then I havenât heard from them again and they said closing of my account completely will take effect as of 27-07-2024. -Iâve been advised by their previous victims  and some friends that works in an actual bank to reach out to BAFIN about this,  which Iâll be doing next. -Any additional tips will be useful from anyone. I will be updating this review as we go if anything changes! Until then, be better safe than sorry and donât get scammed by this franchise.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Christian MÃ¼ller,"I love the bank, have been using it as my main account for almost six years now. Their app is superior to any other bank I know of in Germany. What is really annoying though is how complicated they make it to downgrade your account once you have a subscription. I donât need mine any more, so I decided to cancel it, but you can not do that easily, instead, you have to contact customer support, where you get a bunch of long copy/paste messages, sometimes not even the right ones for your use case, then you have to go into another messaging platform within the app, write a message to confirm and then wait for their confirmation. This should be one button instead, it feels a little greedy with how hard theyâre trying to make it.","Hey Christian,Thanks for taking the time to leave us your feedback. We are sorry to hear that the downgrade process was frustrating for you.Before completing the cancellation of your membership, we need to inform you what perks will be cancelled and what will change on your account and for this we need to know that you agree with the new terms and conditions.

I got a premium account, paid additional costs for a card, then they cancelled it.Now a recent transaction has been in limbo for nearly a week - this is meant to be a modern mobile bank!I will be leaving N26 as soon as possible - terrible experience. UPDATE: re response...I was assured that my membership wouldnt be cancelled, I only wanted to cancel the renewal. The renewal was not due for another few months, the customer agent assured me it would not be cancelled. It was,along with the card I had paid for a few weeks earlier. It was a complete mess. Two recent payments have been held by you for longer than a week as I want to transfer internationally. Due to issues with your compliance, the customers have to suffer and answer multiple questions for a simple international transfer for small amounts (under 100EUR) due to incompetency. The checks are not occasionally, every international transfer I make has this issue.","Hey Iona, Thanks for leaving your feedback.When you make a request to cancel your membership, we always send you a message in the app to inform what features will be cancelled.

Elizabeth Di Rocco,"I have been using N26 for a few years... and I love it. I have not had a bad experience yet. And I doubt I'll ever will, they are that good!Every time I need support, they help immediately: quick and effective. For example: I recently made a payment in a suspicious website (realized this only after I shared my card details). They immediately sent me a new card to make sure my account was safe. Took less than a minute to discuss and get it done. Received the car only 5 days later (event though they said 14 days).I live in Slovenia. I have come to trust them with my income, all my direct debits, standing orders and my savings. They recently added a savings ""bucket"" that gives interest but at the same time allows you to access the money anytime you need it. Flexible and profitable, what else can you ask from a savings bucket?There are a few things I need for my daily banking that N26 doesn't offer and that is why I keep more than one bank account (traditional banks as well as electronic). N26 is my favourite though.

Epik,"They have a smartphone app and a web app to manage the customer accounts. This is a really good move because installing a banking app in a smartphone is not a smart move IMHO. I'm obsessed with security and I only want the best solution for my services, above all for my banking services. Having a sensitive service available on a device that could be stolen, hacked, or that can be unavailable, broken, or lost it's a no go for me.Too bad the web app doesn't offer all the services available in the smartphone app. It's an incomprehensible policy.The N26 web app is safer than the smartphone app because in the web app you are forced to use a two step login while in your smartphone you can have your device unlocked, or protected with an absurd pin, or with a flaw face recognition or fingerprint recognition system that grant you a false safety feeling. I asked for a manual procedure to replace the one that is not available in the web app (I would have supplied N26 with an updated ID) and they refused to help me in any way asserting I should have installed the smartphone app instead.Dear N26, what an ignorant stance... I fear you are only trying to comply with the EU laws but you are not thinking about the sense of these laws, using them to make our accounts safer.P.S.Interestingly enough N26 continuously changes its reply to my review (less than one hour ago the last editing) but still hasn't replied to the core problems I highlight in my review: - why they have a web app if the web app doesn't have all the features the smartphone app has;- why they consider safe to operate with the web app for certain operations and not for certain others;- why they have no manual procedures for those features not implemented in the web app.Plus they seem not understanding that a mobile device is natively less secure than a desktop PC.Anyway, it's no longer my problem because I'm no longer a N26 customer. I find Wise.com better than N26 because with Wise I can do everything with their web app and I never feel insecure in any way about this.","Hey Epik, Thank you for taking the time to share a detailed review. We also welcome product feedback within the app. As an extra security step the N26 app is paired to a smartphone. To take actions from the webapp the paired phone is also needed.

Jonathan Felisberto,"I've been dealing with an unresolved issue with N26 over the past few days regarding a 477 euro transaction on Booking.com that did not go through successfully.From N26's side, the transaction seems to be stuck on hold, but Booking has confirmed the payment was voided and the funds were not collected. I have provided screenshots verifying this to the N26 agent who escalated the case.While I understand these issues can take time to resolve fully, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of a clear timeline or deadline provided by N26's customer service. In my last call, the agent simply told me I would get an update ""soon"" with no specifics on when to expect a resolution. They also seemed to imply the situation was my fault, which does not seem fair given the evidence I've provided.This is an urgent matter, as having 477 euros unaccounted for is causing me significant inconvenience.

J D,"I really like the design of the app and it was super easy to gest started. However, some of the cool features (like the pockets) are only available for the premium plan and this is where things become tricky. I signed up for a yearly subscription for 95â¬, which I consider a lot of money for a bank that doesn't even provide the 4% interest rate. For this, they promise all kinds of extra services like insurance, better experience, etc. but it doesn't seem like they can hold any of those promises. I had a suspicious amount taken from my bank account. I reported this immediately when it happened in April. About 2 months later I still haven't heard back from them. I messaged them multiple times about this issue and they said they are still working on this case. I told them that 2 months is quite long for an urgent issue like this and that I would like the money for my subscription back because they don't seem to be able to hold any of the promises associated with it. They canceled the membership immediately but only refunded a small portion of the 95â¬ back. When I asked them why they weren't able to tell me the reason.

Z D,"Terrible experience moving countries. I used to live a non-Euro (currency) country where N26 offers their services. I moved to a Euro country (Portugal) few months ago and I updated my address at N26. I paid the paid membership to get higher interest rate on my savings. Instead, I got zero interest rate on savings. When contacted N26, and I was told I need CLOSE THE ACCOUNT AND REOPEN IT in the new country. What a terrible inconvenience. I followed the instructions and I have been waiting for the account to get closed, it's been 30+++ days since I requested the account closure and the account hasn't been closed - so I cannot reopen it in my current country.","Hey, Thank you for the review.

Ardees,"Resident in Germany, opened the N26 account in 2018.Overall more than happy with the service. Easy and intuitive UI, functioning customer support.The 4% increase in instant savings with monthly payouts and the possibility to trade stocks / ETF was a BIG win for me. I'm part of those ""how do I start trading or investing"" cluster of people. N26 beated both Scalable Capital and Trade Republic in getting me to invest. I feel safe whenever purchasing stocks, and can withdraw money from savings instantly. For comparison, Scalable has locked some of my money because of 'Instant transfer' policy, which I wasn't aware of.As a Metal customer I also get discounts on products such as Booking, which I use a lot.Overall, N26 provides statistics on your spendings. I like this stuff. It also provides spaces, which is really a good functionality in case you don't want to have everything on your main account (e.g. in case someone steal your card, if you have only a small amount on Main Account, they won't be able to withdraw or purchase online by using all your money.).So yeah.

Sander Robbemond,"I am very disappointed in the customer service and support of the N26 bank. I have a paid account with this bank, so I expect such service from it. More than two months ago, I discovered that more than 50 unauthorized transactions had been made to and from my bank account in three days. These transactions were made by companies I do not know and with whom I have never shared my information. As a result, a large amount ultimately disappeared from my account. The N26 customer service advised me to block my current cards, order new cards and start a dispute for the missing money. From the start I did exactly what customer service advised me to do. Yet it took a full month before my dispute was even accepted for starting the process. Now, 2.5 months later, I still have heard nothing more about this. I have asked several times for information about the status of my dispute, but there has been no contact or information from the bank or what so ever and my money is still missing! The question of how it is possible that, despite the so-called safe systems, many unauthorized transactions can take place and money can simply be withdrawn from my account remains unanswered. This does not give me confidence in the safety of this bank. To clarify, I have NEVER given my information to anyone. According to the customer service employee, two replacement cards could be sent abroad (outside the EU) easily and quickly (for an additional fee). Unfortunately, months later this appears to be almost impossible apparently???Further communication with customer service showed that they could not send the passes to a DHL point or hotel address, while this was previously possible. I also had to stay at the given postal address for at least 2 weeks. This is quite difficult since I am still travelling and passing through, but I adjusted my itinerary anyway and stayed at the same address for more than 2 weeks. After 2.5 weeks no news about my replacement cards. When I contacted customer service again, they apologized for the negligence and promised to send the cards to any new given address (bevause I had to move) for free via a PowerMove (so-called special express shipping). I provided a new address and would receive the cards within 5 to 7 business days. After I had not received anything after 7 days and contacted customer service AGAIN, I was told that again they failed to send anything. If it's not possible, just say it's not possible instead of stringing me along and making me stay somewhere at great expense! The N26 supposedly profiles itself as a traveler's bank, but despite of all my efforts and numerous contact, I have now been abroad without a bank card for more than 2.5 months and it is going to stay like. I am not changing my schedule for them to mess up my travels again, so I had them send my cards to my home adress (where I am not going to be for the next couple of months) and they even messed that up! They only send one card instead of two!As long as there are no problems it maybe is a great bank, but as soon as there is a problem they don't care, make all kinds of promises they don't keep and simply leave you stranded. During the past months I often felt hopeless in the face of stiff, unprofessional and, above all, incompetent customer service. I absolutely do not recommend this bank!I hope that N26 will gradually gain the decency to take its customers and their complaints seriously. Please read previous reviews from the many victims! Previous reviews prove that these same hacks and security failures/problems have been occurring for some time already and that N26 gets away with it time and time again with a poor excuse or shifts the blame to those affected.----added after first response of N26----So after writing the review above (first it was in Dutch), N26 replied that they don't support the dutch language (but they do support it on their hotline I think???). I do not mind writing the review in English, but there is no way of replying to the message so I replaced the dutch review for the english. ----added after second response----And of course, like with all the other reviews, the bank replies with: please contact us through instagram. Again...I have been in contact with customer service for many hours through their official channels and they failed as a proper customer service continuously. Why would Instagram be any better? And what if I don't have Instagram?----added after more N26 misery----So now, 3 months after blocking my 2 bank cards the unauthorized transactions continue! I checked with customer service again and they confirmed that both unauthorized transactions were done by using the cards that I already had blocked and destroyed 3 months ago! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? Also, because of these transactions my balance is now MINUS! I NEVER APPROVED ON THAT!","Hey, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Ser Pe,"Edited on 26.06.2024 My review was about N26 Bank not returning my money after closing my new account, even after promising to transfer it to the account I provided within two business days. However, it turns out I made a mistake. N26 actually informed me a year ago that the money was returned to them and requested another account from me. Unfortunately, I misunderstood that message.

Hello,There is still â¬170,- on my account and it is kind of not possible so far to get my own money back.Since a while I've had an account and it was all working okay until at some point we were requested to upload a scan of an ID. My daughter has the app and the account is on my name so it took some time before we could send the document. From there we got some emails and at some point the account was completely blocked. In a later email we were requested to send details of the account where the remaining  money could be sent to. This has been sent almost a month ago but it remains quiet. Impossible to reach them another way. The chat helpdesk looks into it and then just leaves.Update: I received an email that correspondence is done via the email address known by them. But that is part of the problem, I have replied with documents requested on the 6th of May and send another email but I get no response or confirmation that the documents are received. Nothing. I am not sure if I should leave my email address, connected to my account, on this page. But according the file number, this can be found.","Hey, Thank you for sharing your details.

The N26 support staff is unknowledgeable, unhelpful and can't even speak proper English!! They refused to help me, claiming they were a mobile app, and that unless iI had access to my phone number again they could not do anything due to ""security reasons"". I work in app development and product design, so there are other ways to verify identity that are NOT a phone number. But N26 don't seem to have considered this when designing their app. So, no way to get to my money or insurance claim to help me. Unbelievable and absolutely horrifying that N26 as a BANK doesn't have a fail-safe procedure for when someone can't get access to their phone number due to theft. Also, the only way to get in contact with them is chat...which is BURIED under pages of the help sections. They make it so hard for a user to find the necessary information to help themselves.

Alexander Pakakis,"For my trip to Morocco, I decided to upgrade to N26 YOU to avoid the 1.7% foreign transaction fee. I consulted with a N26 representative beforehand on how the upgrade works. Upon upgrading, a new Mastercard is issued, but I was unsure about what happens with the old card. I was repeatedly assured that my old Mastercard would not be deactivated without my action. I believed this assurance and was also informed that if I ever downgraded back to N26 STANDARD, the card replacement would be free.A week into my stay in Morocco, exactly what I feared happened: N26 deactivated my old Mastercard without my knowledge, even though I had taken no action to deactivate the card. (fyi: my new Mastercard had not even arrived at my home in Germany, as informed by my roommate.) This left me stranded in Morocco unable to make payments with my N26 card. Contacting N26 customer service, I was told that the old card was deactivated due to the upgrade, and later they mentioned a system error had mistakenly deactivated all old cards involved in recent upgrades.N26 advised me to use a virtual card in their app to withdraw cash from ATMs with NFC technology. However, finding such ATMs in Morocco proved nearly impossible, as I couldn't locate any with NFC functionality despite visiting numerous ATMs across major cities like Marrakesh and Fes. This was particularly problematic since cash is predominantly used in Morocco, such as for paying tourist taxes at hotels.I repeatedly communicated these issues to N26 customer service, stressing the inconvenience and lack of access to necessary funds. Each time, their only response was to escalate the issue internally to see what went wrong. More than two weeks have passed since the incident, and I have yet to receive any form of compensation or remedy for the lost vacation days and financial stress caused, despite it being entirely the fault of N26. The lack of support made me feel utterly alone in Morocco.Despite N26's statements, guess how much a new card will cost after I downgrade to N26 Standard? â¬10! N26 customer support informed me that they will waive this fee as a gesture of goodwill. However, the quality of customer support still leaves me with some reservations.What I would have expected from N26, after I informed them that they had deactivated my account without my involvement, would have been for them to contact me (not the other way around) and say: ""Hello, something really silly has happened, and it's entirely our fault. We understand your problem. Please go to this building where cash will be provided to you. We wish you a pleasant vacation. We are sorry for what has happened."" Unfortunately, I received no such response from N26 at all. It's a poor show.N26 advertises itself as ""The bank youâll love"" but in light of this experience, it seems they might not truly stand by this motto when it comes to caring for their customers in times of need.Update 31.05.2024I have now been downgraded to N26 STANDARD again. Guess what happened. The two Spaces I had before my upgrade are now gone. Furthermore, I can now only withdraw cash for free three times a month. Before the upgrade, it was more times. So, this upgrade to N26 YOU and the subsequent downgrade did not benefit me at all. Even though I agreed with customer service that I would receive an N26 Mastercard, I have not received any message from N26 regarding the Mastercard even after more than a week.

malek kilani,"I was victim of a fraud somehow with my N26 card that I used online but always stayed in my possession.  I noticed surprisingly, there were some transactions that I did neither see or approve that got processed by some non existing companies of 508 euros and I can't even identify the original currency it was processed in when checking them. The investigation was first launched by mastercard who didnÂ´t reimburse the amount but the N26 team reviewed the case and finally reimbursed me after I raised a complaint.

RISKY RICK,"I love this app, but it needs a bit of stability work. The amount of times the app ""times out"" while using it is not really acceptable. you open it, look at something, and then go on to do something else, then when you open it again 30 minutes later it has timed out, you have to force quit it and re-open it. I have used other mobile banking apps like Monzo in the UK (still the king of mobile banking apps), and never had issues like this. Also, the amount of times I get the ""Sorry about that, something went wrong on our end!"" message, again, forcing me to force close the app and open it again, is also not acceptable. Multiple times moving money between spaces doesnt work, you get an error. Again, this is a valiant effort. But for a banking app where I keep most of my money, these issues should not exist. Really good effort, but falling just shy of being great. I hope it improves in the future.","Hey Rick,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.The app will log you out due to security reasons if you leave it for some moments.

Miro,"The ease of use is pretty nice, all the major operations are well designed and straightforward. There are 2 points that I didn't love: (1) The way spaces are presented, when you create a space and send money in there, the overall ""balance"" does not change, so a space is just a bucket in the main account. It was an unpleasant surprise when I thought I was saving, but in fact I wasn't. (2) It ""auto"" categorizes transactions, but gets recurring transactions wrong every time. Every month I have to manually change my standing order from ""Misc"" to ""Household and utilities"". This is especially stupid when it then calculates budgets on this data","Hey Miro, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. You can change the visible general balance of your account after sending money to a specific Space. To do this, go to Finances tab and under ""Your Balance"" at the top left corner you can see a number of spaces hidden and shown.

Kao FÃ©lix,"I've been a customer of N26 for a few years now and while I do like the app and some of the features available, I'm turning away from them since I feel like they took money from me twice for no good reason through applying their very hefty 9 euros (in Spain) insufficient funds fee.I'm making use of their spaces features and I have more than enough to cover the bills that are being charged. The money is in their power and I don't buy what I heard from customer support that they can't move the money for me when I have all this automation in place to move money from my main account to my savings account. They could easily use my spaces balance to cover the bit missing for paying my bill. But they choose instead to bounce my transaction and charge me 9 euros for that. There's also no explanation given on to why exactly this hefty fee is applied. The customer support pointed me to the article stating that ""Yes, we will charge you this fee"" and the only ""prevention"" solution is to enable overdraft (which is only available in Germany and Austria), so I can only guess it's maybe a push for customers to enable it?When I tried to find information online about this, the first result was a blog post from them proudly stating that they are not the type of bank that charges you such fees. After I raised this with their support today, of course the page /en-eu/blog/insufficient-funds-fee at their website is mysteriously missing. However you can still catch a glimpse of it in the Wayback Machine before it throws you in a redirect loop.I also found this article also stating that the fee will be charged according to the terms and conditions, but when you read the actual PDF document it doesn't mention fees or the 3 or 9 euros charged in any point in the document: /en-de/payments-transfers-and-withdrawals/direct-debits-and-standing-orders/why-was-i-charged-a-direct-debit-feeAnyway, I'm moving away from this bank. When I opened the account I was excited about trying a modern online bank. I really bought into the idea and the promise that this is not like other banks, it's transparent, etc. But now I feel it's just like any other bank, happy to take your money for no good reason.Edit: I'm adding this after the response from the bank. Even if the fee is ""valid"", doesn't make it any less user hostile. Still, I would like for you to point me out WHERE in the terms and conditions does it mention a fee. Your page does, but I'm failing to find any mention of if in the PDF document with the actual SEPA terms.I have round up and rules to automatically move money around, you can't convince me you are not able to cover a bill for me with money from another space. If you need my consent, give me an option and I will gladly opt in to allow you to do that automatically for me. Also, I'm pretty sure I remember getting the notification more timely within the day the bill was going to be charged. If I get a few days early, it means I need to move a chunk of my money out of instant savings to cover the bill + any unexpected spending I might have, because if I'm even 1 euro short to pay my bill, you will punish me for 9 euros for my mistake. It's terrible terrible user experience and the way this is setup makes me feel like you want me to fail, even if that's not your intention. Edit 2: I'm adding this since N26 took action and refunded me my anual subscription due to this complaint. While I appreciate the gesture to some extent, I also think it's disappointing that as a customer you have to resort to reviews to get your complaint validated somehow. It's a bit late now since I already switched over to a different bank, but I do hope they reconsider whether it makes sense to charge such fees when they are also encouraging people to move their money around freely.","Hey Kao,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. First we are sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with us.If your direct debit is linked with the IBAN on your main account, and the balance canât cover it when itâs due, itâll bounce and youâll be charged a â¬9 fee (this fee is valid for accounts with Spanish T&Cs).Please note, we are unable to transfer the money on Spaces or Savings to cover it. Only the account holder can transfer the money between Spaces and the main account. We will always remind you to top up your main account by sending you a message in the app and an email on the due date of your direct debit if there's not enough funds on your main account to cover it. You can also see a list of the direct debits that will be charged in the next days on the top of your transaction list.

JohnDoe,"First time signing up: Uploaded identification documents. App tells me it could take up to 2 business days. 2 weeks later, still nothing. Contacting support. Telling me something went wrong and that they reset it and i need to re do the process (WHY not contacting me when something went wrong earlier?!?!)Second time: The same deal. Stuck on identification needed to redo the process. AGAIN WITHOUT NOTICEThird time: Identification worked. Now stuck on Proof of adress. I uploaded it, closed the app and then the app tells me to reupload it again. Contacting support AGAIN to check if the upload worked or that it was denied or something because AGAIN NO COMMUNICATION.Support tells me the account was CLOSED for unknown reason. AGAIN WITHOUT COMMINUCATING THIS. and tell me again i need to re signup.... So just for the fun of it, for the FORTH TIME trying to open and sign up, the dam app tells me there is something wrong with the information i provided and need to contact support.... I really suggest you DO NOT open an acocunt with this BAD company. If this is the result by just trying to open an account, i am 100 positive your money is not safe with them either. EDIT: See the reaction of N26 below. This is the exact problem with them. ""Come talk to us via the chat/Socials"" While i explicitly say in the review support does not/can not do anything. Support only offers ""sorry's and assurances they can not keep"". Another support employer today; i asked what happens when this N26 was my main account and it got closed without notifications whatsoever, i would have a huge problem due to unableto pay bills or recieve paychecks. The support employer simply replied, we send it to a different department and you should just wait untill you get an email because a closed account can never be reopend.So N26 closes accounts for no reason, no notification the account will be or is closed, not via email, not via the app, not via phone/sms, and just simply say contact and wait. They do not care whatsoever if they send their N26 clients towards damnation with the sudden closing of accounts. STAY AWAY FROM N26 IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEYEDIT as reply to N26 Reaction: No thank you, i have been contacting you for over 10 weeks with over 20 employers now without any solution, i have NO trust if i contact again this mirraculously gets solved. Even worse is that N26 is actually asking to send fraudulent sensitive info like passport and such over the most unsecure way of communication, email.

Nikki Eberharter,"Been weeks of back and forth and I have been denied access to my account. I asked to have account closed and funds returned and each time I am asked to provide more information or write another statement.

This despite photos, passport and documents being submitted as requested.It does not take weeks to close an account and why am I being blocked in the first place. Fraudulent behavior and theft. So frustrating to have to take legal action to have a company follow the law.In response to Peter...I did over the course of 2 weeks everything which was asked.

I have sent pictures, reestablish identity, typed sentences word for word in and email as requested, and each time I am later told oh thanks but actually now do something else.I stand by my assessment...this company and uts employees operate fraudulently.

A Kelly,"I used to bank with AIB (Ireland) but when my student and graduate account was closed and I started being charged fees, I compared the market and changed to N26. It is an incredible digital bank - my favourite features are Sub-Accounts that can have IBANs and Auto-Sorting. I get paid monthly so all the money for bills gets auto sorted into a sub-account and then it has its own IBAN so direct debits run from it. Itâs great to segregate money without having loads of different accounts. Iâve had experiences with customer service for blocking direct debits or getting more info on transactions and theyâre very responsive. SEPA Instant is also great so I donât need to use Revolut to transfer instantly to friends. There have been so many feature releases recently like joint accounts and savings so Iâm looking forward to whatâs next. One negative is that I occasionally have a cheque to lodge which I canât do with a digital bank. Iâve retained my AIB account so I can lodge cash and cheques and transfer to N26. Thatâs really the only negative I can think of. I recommend N26 to all my friends and family as banking fees are reduced and the functionality is superior. Itâs also a German regulated bank which is great. While Revolut is a regulated bank now, I find itâs UX confusing and ever-changing. Plus I donât like how aggressively they advertise credit.",Pending,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,5.0,0,2024,Positive

Oleg Yakovenko,"In December 2023, I was enticed by N26âs marketing campaign to switch my banking services to them. The offer included a â¬100 bonus for using N26 as my primary salary account. Motivated by this promise, I invested considerable time transferring all my services and SEPA mandates to the new account.However, after completing the migration, N26 deemed my account âineligibleâ for the bonus. They cited a failed signup attempt in 2022 due to the lack of a German residence permit card at the timeâa requirement I later fulfilled. Despite this, N26 had technically classified me as a customer since that initial attempt.The outcome is disheartening. The marketing campaignâs objectiveâto acquire a new customerâwas achieved. Yet, as that customer, I am left with frustration instead of the anticipated bonus. Itâs disappointing when technicalities overshadow a customerâs genuine effort and anticipation.Update 1: According to the company's response, which is false, I did not have any N26 bank accounts in 2022 because I simply did not meet the eligibility criteria as per N26 policies. Additionally, the promotional page stated: ""Open a new N26 Girokonto and receive a â¬100 bonus when deposits of at least â¬700 are made for 3 consecutive months."" Did I have a Girokonto? No. Did I have any accounts or transactions? No, as well.Update 2: Judging by the availability of account statements from March 2022, it appears that they opened an account for me, which is an even bigger problem than I initially realized. This indicates the existence of a bank account I was unaware of, issued without proper identification and access through the application process.The terms and conditions state: ""We (N26) are legally obliged to verify your identity prior to opening an account."" Now, the question for N26 is: How exactly was my identity verified in 2022?","Hey Oleg, Thank you for taking the time to leave a service review and for sharing your details with us.

Why once you change your device you are unable to associate it and the customer support can only recommend to reset your device or reinstall your app? Otherwise the user should make another verification even if it was already done when the device was changed 2 months ago?! I have been having an account since 2019 btw. Why the bot gives you instructions and the indicated fields are not present on the app and no one can answer why is that? And the best one is what nationality is indicated on your document?

Eduardo Tavares RÃ¶del,"I recently encountered a significant issue with N26 that has left me without access to my funds and with a frustrating customer support experience. This situation began when I tried to pair my new phone with the N26 app, necessitating immediate human support due to the unexpected issue's complexity. Despite multiple attempts and interactions with various support agents, my problem remains unresolved.The major turn for the worse came after an attempt to revalidate my identity, which failed to solve the issue and now prevented me from accessing my funds in any form (ATM, web, or app). This issue has rendered my account effectively unusable, significantly affecting my financial responsibilities.What is most disappointing is the inconsistency in the service provided. The frequent handovers among different operators have only prolonged the resolution time and escalated my frustration. I have expressed the urgency of my situation through a formal complaint and directly requested expedited processing, yet the standard response time of 15 business days feels excessive under these circumstances.The lack of a quick and effective resolution and the inability to access my money has led me to consider escalating the matter through regulatory bodies or legal action. I am awaiting a more responsive and effective resolution from the N26 Ombudsman.For anyone considering N26, be aware that while the bank offers innovative banking solutions, their customer support might not meet your expectations in times of real need. Unfortunately, this experience has diminished my trust in N26, and I caution potential customers to consider this review when choosing.Updates:11/05: still no solution, and now one week since the last contact from the support.21/05: The 15 working days given by the Ombudsman have been over for 2 days now, and there has been no contact or solution. It is evident what needs to be done from my side.BE AWARE OF THIS BANK. WHILE EVERYTHING FOLLOWS THE HAPPY PATH, YOU WILL THINK THEY ARE A NICE THING. SHALL YOU NEED THEM TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS, YOU WILL SEE THEIR TRUE COLORS.","Hey Eduardo, Thank you for sharing your experience and for providing details of your account.

Consumer,"Hello, i been using n26 since 2021. But recently i already closed it for the issue of my identity verification. My document is expired but I already renew my permit but it takes time it to be release. Because of this my account is restricted and cannot make payments or withdrawal but can make deposits. Because i need my funds i ask the support if they can just transfer my funds to my other account so that i donât need to closed it. But they said it cannot be done the best option is to closed the account and they will transfer the funds. So i closed my account i provided them with my documents and the Iban of my other bank so that they will transfer it there.

Fortunately, the funds were eventually reimbursed, and I received a new card as a precaution.However, just this week, I was charged again by the same shops.When I reached out for help, customer support insisted that I gather information from the merchant regarding these transactions, giving me a tight deadline of only five days.This is unreasonable, especially since the transactions were in a foreign currency, and I have no clue about the origin of these transactions.

Dominick,"I am utterly disappointed with the service provided by N26. I made a purchase in December 2023 through my N26 account, but to this day, I have not received the product. Despite promises from the seller to refund the amount, I am yet to see a single cent returned to my account.When I reached out to N26 for assistance, it took them a staggering six weeks to respond to my complaint. To make matters worse, they demanded translations for over 20 emails exchanged with the seller, even though the crucial information could easily be translated using tools like Google Translate.This delay and unnecessary demand for translations only added to my frustration. Overall, my experience with N26 has been nothing short of disastrous. I strongly advise anyone considering using their services to think twice. This level of incompetence and disregard for customer satisfaction is simply unacceptable.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Legitti,"It is pricey and when you want to close your account fully, it's a complete hassle. They took out one cent from the account and now are saying they can't remove it because of the fee they took themselves. I've sent numerous messages and requests regarding the account closure, but it still has yet to happen. After talking to my friends about the situation, they are also looking to switch banks, so much for customer care.Edit: almost 2 weeks later they are still trying to make me add money to cover their 0.01â¬ fee for Spaces that was taken out, even though I've never used the feature. Edit2: Well over a month later I finally got my account removed after these reviews. Feeling bad for the average Joe. I'm so much more happy with the new back I switched to.

If you have a German IBAN you are generally entitled to convert your N26 account to a p-account. This means that in case you have an active garnishment, you'll have a monthly allowance of normally â¬1.410 which remains accessible to you and inaccessible to the creditor on a per month basis. An active alimony garnishment can decrease that amount. Please note, however, that we need to report the conversion of your account into p-account to SCHUFA AG.Best Regards, Peter - N26 Support",2024-04-08,2024-04-08,1.0,0,2024,Positive

Les,"Support agents are often unavailable, yet required for things such as changing your membership plan or initiating a chargeback. Some things still go through a separate inbox in the app, and PDFs. It's 2024 but I feel like I'm stuck in 2014.Ever since they fixed their app, Revolut is better in literally every way.Added after response from N26:Unless it has changed in the past month, human assistance *is* required to change/cancel your membership. Literal quote from support bot: ""If you wish, we can stop the automatic renewal of your membership after the first 12 months. Once it stops, your premium card will be deactivated. If you'd prefer to stop it sooner, we can cancel your membership immediately. If you want to go ahead with either option, just ask me for human help."" (Note that at the time of my request, my membership had been active and unchanged for over 18 months.)When they say 'Messages in the app', they're not talking about a live support chat with an agent who immediately responds, but an email-like inbox. This makes many support requests terribly slow and it's plainly unnecessary. (It's not any more secure than a live chat: you just need your app PIN for both (the same PIN you also use for fund transfers). Surely they don't mean live chat is insecure because they don't trust their support agents?)","Hey Les,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.We are always looking to improve the experience for our users.

Even disabling completely the biometric in the application settings the app asks and fails to recognise the fingerprint when trying to show the card details.In 5 days their condom customer interface (condom is a rubber thing to protect from real contact!) has refused to solve the problem and blamed phone manufacturers for their faulty software. I reported to google and asked to remove the app from the store. Let's see who is worse N26 or Google.,"Hey Pietro, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Mark,"Terrible service all round. Customer service takes days (if at all) to respond - and no way to call them on the phone for normal users. I suppose this is why other online banks eg Revolut have twice the amount of users and half the amount of negative reviews. I would avoid N26 (having been a long time customer since 2018 until recently terminated). It's a substandard bank with HOPELESS customer service. Edit: Thanks to cust svce here for the response! However, there was no email yesterday. (A notification was received on Monday to which I reponded. Still waiting for a reply...) The link you have posted below doesn't have any relevance, unfortunately.","Hey Mark,Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.Please reply to the email you received yesterday so the matter can be taken care of.

Susan,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICEI have recently been trying to get in touch with this bank prior to joining their n26 Metal offering.  The detail regarding one-off deposit interest rates on this site is unclear and I will not join this bank till I have my questions answered.  There is no way to access a person through their Chat facility on their ap without first joining and paying their membership fee.  At one point a bot answered, could not answer my questions, asked me if âI would line to speak with a humanâ and that they would get back to me.  No one got back to me.  I then tried to send my questions via their support email address (support at n62 dot com) which Iâm not permitted to post here (Rules of this website) wherein I asked all my questions.  There was no automatic acknowledgement of my email to them as you would normally expect and no response for three days now.  The lack of acknowledgement with a query number leads me to believe that my emails have just disappeared.  To add further to this problem I tried twice to go through the identification process, did everything right but it did not work.  I then got an automatic message from them saying that I should try again but someone would assist me if it did not work again.  When I clicked on this link I came right back to a demand that I pay my membership in n26 Metal virtually being locked out of going any further unless I paid my first membership fee.  This is a terrible service and if someone will explain why the email address (above) for their support department is not working Iâd like to know why??  Or give me here an address or someone to contact who will answer my interest rate query and help me to get through the identification process.I was provided with no relevant complaint reference number which I could have posted here so someone from your company could contact me to assist me.Do you not want new customers?BadP S - many hours laterYou get no kudos n26 for doing your job and then getting 5 stars.  You stand or fall on how you treat your customers or in my case potential customers, who are having problems with you.  This is the acid test.  Whatever about any other company, with banks if there is no trust there is nothing.  And Iâm talking about a large sum!!Even now there is no response from you either here or an answer to my emails - just silence.  Do you only respond here sporadically to give the impression that you have a real service to offer?Iâm going now to shop around elsewhere.

ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð° Ð¥ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµÐ½ÐºÐ¾,"I would be laughing if this situation wasn't so sad. N26 just tried to stifle my voice when we left a review from my boyfriend's account. Of course they try to hide the truth. It looks like many other people are experiencing the same kind of security issues with this bank. They used Trustpilot's guidelines to try and get my review removed instead of getting their backoffice to initiate the chargeback which they said they would initiate a month ago. My account got hacked by hackers from Bulgaria who drained by entire account balance on a third website. I informed n26 immediately about the situation. They blocked the card, and after a lengthy process of them not doing anything to contact the institution where the money was spent they first waited for the transaction to be settled, then interrogated me to see if they can pin the error on to me, and only after a week they agreed to initiate a chargeback. Problem is, that was over a 6 weeks ago and no chargeback has been initiated.They ignored my messages or respond with a generic ""we are experiencing a delay in processing chargebacks and cannot speed this up"".This people is why N26 is not a real bank and your money is not safe with them. Also, special thanks to the most rudest of rude backoffice employees named Shamir. We've promptly reported them to BaFin and so should you.p.s: I came to Germany as a refugee from Ukraine. N26 allowed for all my money to be taken by hackers. We didn't have any food to eat because of N26's irresponsibility and lack of security. Come N26 now close my account because I told people the truth (which I told you I would do last week). update: After confirming they would initiate a chargeback, they came back with a dishonest excuse claiming google pay was used for these transactions and it could only have happened with my consent, which is not true. I think this is evidence that n26 simply engaged in brazen fraud in front of our eyes.","Hey Daryna, We're sorry to hear about your experience and the difficulties you've faced.

David Fogel,"My account was locked due to the banks own policies (they removed part of garnishment for their own costs). Currently at 10 days trying to get any valueable response from them. Countless emails and messages with service desk lead me nowhere so far. I have absolutely no funds for living. Direct Debits, food, rent, insurance all is now in arrears due to their actions. When it works itâs ok, but when something goes sideways their customer service is absolutely useless with their copy/paste responses. I guess this is what youâll get for using âVirtual Bankâ rather than brick and mortar. Edit: I see that N26 is refusing to take responsibility for this so I will be dead honest: They charged me for account fees out of money already legally blocked for the garnishment purpose. 150 euro was the garnishment and you whitholding nearly 4k euro. If you have to act according to the law, paragraphs and court orders then obide fully to it. Additionally I find it amusing that N26 responded faster on the negative review than with their ""High priority"" tickets with ""senior"" team. Absolutely ridiculous.","Hey David, We're really sorry for any inconvenience.As a licensed and regulated European bank, when thereâs an active garnishment on your account, we are legally obliged to block the necessary funds to cover the claim in accordance with Â§ 829 ZPO.

We do this 4 weeks after receiving the garnishment or transfer order, unless you choose an alternative solution in this period.If you have provided all the necessary information and your case has been escalated by our internal team, the dedicated department will reach out to you as soon as possible via messages in the app.You can find more information about this on our Support Centre here: https://support.n26.com/en-de/account-and-personal-details/ganrishment-insolvency-p-account/what-is-a-garnishmentBest regards,Bella, Your N26 Support Team.",2024-03-05,2024-03-05,2.0,0,2024,Positive
Ahmed Barakat,"Ja hey have one of the worst verification team ever,After being on hold and trying to rech their portal several times , the agent picked up the call , she was unprofessional at all , playing all the time with her hair and doesnât make any eye contact showing a disrespect, not only this , she asked me a question if I am alone in the place where I call her from and if some one taught me something he the answers of the security questionsâ¦.??!That was the first time for me to hear this in my life hallo I do have different accounts in different international banks , so I asked her what does she means with her question because I didnât get what she was questioning..!!

Is this something usual and normal for you?

NELLY G.,"I was in the process of buying a used car and needed to wire the money to the seller, the transaction failed, and the explanation was : technical error. I renewed the attempt but to no avail. I tried to wire money on another account in mine but same thing. When you have a basic account, you can only join them via chat, itâs extremely slow, so I decided to upgrade my account to Smart so I would have access to phone assistance, supposedly available Â« every day from 07:00 to 23:00 CET, including Sundays and bank holidays.â What a joke! Sure you get someone on the phone, but they are unable to help you, they pretty much just take a message. I can pay with my card and retrieve cash at the ATM, but I cannot wire money at all. We are now Tuesday, and I still havenât heard from them. Even worse, when I log onto my account, it tells me I have exceeded the monthly â¬20,000, to try again next month, which is preposterous! Iâm way way far from this! They admitted it on the phone but couldnât do anything but to report it to their technical department. I am meeting with my attorney this morning to discuss legal steps if I donât get a resolution soon. EDITla reponse de N26 a ce retour d'experience demontre encore un manque de formation de leurs agents. Le probleme est a present resolu, et n'avait rien a voir avec EU regulations or restrictions. It took 5 agents  to finally find one who thought of everything, including the fact that outgoing transfers were blocked since a hack attempt on my account a year ago. At the time I am the one who requested this restriction, but they forgot to remove it, once the problem was solved.","Hey Nelly,Thanks for leaving your review.

I ordered something in late November 2023, but it never showed up, and the seller has tons of bad reviews. When I complained to N26 in mid-January, all they did was tell me to wait and didn't really answer my questions about how to fix the issue. They didn't even tell me if the merchant responded or not. They even sent me the same response they had sent three weeks before. Luckily, I didn't spend much, but I can't imagine how bad it would be if it was something expensive.

Evgeny,"This is the worst experience of my life being a customer of this bank. I have not been able to access my money for more than three months. The bank does nothing to help me in any way.

I'd tell support. They'd tell me it was because the old one still hadn't been removed, that I needed to wait. So I'd wait. They'd tell me it was ready. I'd create one.

Doesn't seem like they know what they're doing, and lost all my trust in their banking and user management ability. Would not use them again.If you already have an account, definitely don't close down your account to try to open a new one.","Hey Steve, Thank you for the feedback.

I think itâs the best for all the reasons: it doesnât have hidden fees, so itâs perfect for online shopping with fair currency conversion, it has amazing features to budget, I love the shared spaces (you can use it with friends with a free account if only you have a paid account) and you can change almost all card and account rules in real time and it even has instant transfers. On top of that, all of my interactions with customer service have been excellent. I canât really say anything bad at all about them. The app is a delight to use, never failed me at anything and itâs consistently getting better. I closed all my other accounts besides the mandatory one I have to have in my country (that has very expensive and fees for everything).

L Alawi,"Be very careful, once I had given this bank 5 stars, now I would give it minus 5!!!! be careful, one day they will tell you that you did not give them enough info, and they will close your account and not return your money for many months. You will need to complain to the Central Bank of your country to get it back, hassle, costs ect... It is like hell. Do not trust them.A couple of years ago I opened an account in this bank on recomendaciÃ³n of my daughter. It was very good at first, very fast, very reliable, at first. However, one day I received an email telling me to go to a link that was supposed to appear in my account as soon as I log in. And following this supposed link, I am going to find a form to fill out to review my personal information and confirm it. THERE WERE NO LINK ANYWHERE, I called the so called ""support"" and they could not explain why it did not appear on my screen. They told me to read the message that the bank sent me internally. There were NO MESSAGE EVER in the mail box. Only then, after 2 years, that the mailbox was activated, I actually sent her a screen shot showing that there are no messages in the mail box. When the mail was working,  I could see the messages sent, which were the same that they sent by email. BUT STILL THERE WERE NO MESSAGE ABOUT HOW TO GIVE OR CONFIRM MY ID. So I went to the account, I looked for my personal info, it was all correct, and there was no way to do anything to it. A few weeks past, I received a message telling that the account will be closed and I need to send them an account where they could send the money, that must sent bu PDF, with a screen shot of the account, my ID document etc.. I did all that 3 months ago. And during those 3 months I complained about the money is not in my account in the BBVA, and NO ANWER, calling is of no use as they answer YOU MUST WAIT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU. All the monthly payments were turned down, even though I have money in the account. I could not retrieve my money on my own. I lost business because I did not have the money to move around. My daughter is about to give birth in America and I am not able to afford the trip nor by gifts. I went to the Central Bank of Spain, they told me that I would need to start the process of complaining from square one. I needed to send the complain AGAIN but this time in writing my snail mail, to the office in Madrid, and wait another 31 days before filing a formal complain at the Central Bank. I wrote a certified mail to bank in Madrid, 2 weeks ago. They received and signed for the certified mail, but of course they ignored me. So, I am waiting for the full 31 days before going back to the Central Bank and deposit the formal complaint. I am writing to help people stay away from this bank not to fall in the same situation. It is not that they want steal the money it is because they are like kids playing bankers, they count on software that make people look like crooks, they are not counting on human intelligence, they blame it all on the computer. When I went to check the bank on social media I found a massive account blocking and people found out that people lost their homes for not being able to get to their money to pay their obligations, wedding cancelled, and these kids playing bankers are loosing experienced people, I found out that they are loosing the smarted people in the banking business that were there to help them out, I don't think this kindergarten will stay in business for long.As an answer to N26,They are skipping the main subject here. The subject is competence, knowhow, capability, knowledge, on how to ran a business. We are not talking about anything else.From N26 I got in one single week various emails all contradicting one another. One is telling me not deposit money in the account because it is closed, the next one tells me that if I do not make a deposit the bills will be turned down, the next one says, there is no money in the account, the next one says, we are reviewing your case for complexity, the next one says, your are contacting us from a different email address (and it was not so), the next one says, the account is now closed, and the next one says, if you want to close your account click here, and the next one says.... and on and on.... and blaming the computer is most stupid thing to do because the computer executes a manmade software... another message said we will send the money to your new account on Feb 13, and the next message said, again and again, your account is now closed, the money was sent to your new account. AND OF COURSE IT DID NOT. That is why I am saying these are some guys who have no idea on how to conduct business and yet they are playing with people's money. What a shame.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Still didn't hear anything after 6 weeks.Got a new phone, so I tried again. This time I finally could verify and open an account. But now the device pairing didn't work. I received emails indicating the device pairing was successful, while it wasn't. Contacted support, who said I needed to verify for them to help me. Which I couldn't because my device wasn't paired. After following their instructions, I got kicked out of the support chat and had to start all over again. The support is completely useless, just talking you through basic steps even when you explained in detail what the problem is. Sometimes it isn't clear if you are talking to an AI or not. Also, their actual support agents are not based in EU. They are based in India, and therefore they cannot lawfully ask for, or work with, you personal information. Yet they will ask for your personal details. N26 is in direct violation with EU GDPR 2016/679.The N26 app is mainly a webapp, and therefore it is slow, unresponsive and buggy. Please AVOID N26 at all costs. Consider Revolut instead. After my account is closed I will write a summons for N26 to appear in court.

I submitted my ID for account re-verification (something I already did in 2019 for my account opening).Except that I received an email informing me that I won't be able to open a N26 account even though I already have my EXISTING account and I have a balance on it.Case number: ref:!00D240H3gm.!5005J0a6rGL:ref I haven't been able to log into my account or use my balance for a month now, I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed!UPDATE: so after requiring help from N26, they decided  to CANCEL my account even though I specified that I'm currently on travel but my country of residence is France ! Apparently N26 just mercilessly and unfairly decides to cancel people's accounts even though we EXPLAIN the circumstances! I even submitted my French residence card and all the proof! Seriously you are the worst bank I've ever seen with not even acknowledging of clients' individual needs and circumstances ! You seriously caused me extreme psychological distress because of your inefficiency in resolving your client's issues ! Unbelievably disappointed. People if you ever consider to open an account with them RUN. Seriously RUN","Hey Imane,We are sorry to hear that you are facing issues with your account.

Evgeny Iakovlev,"I've been using N26 for 4 years now. I kept most of my money in a feature they call ""Spaces"", which is just a way to store money away from the main card account. Around September 2023 this feature stopped working from the iOS app, i was not able to either move money into the space or move money OUT of the space. You can imagine my concern, no access to 95% of my funds is very scary. I contacted support, followed their instructions to the letter, but it didn't help. Web version worked though, so i thought i can wait until they fix it. Months went by, but the app was still broken. I reported that to support again, with the same result.Finally, in January 2024 i needed access to all my space savings to pay for a mortgage. iOS app still didn't allow me to move money from space to main account as it didn't for 3-4 months now, but to my horror i discovered, that the web app is also broken now. I panicked, contacted support, again without any help. Finally on my 2-nd attempt to contact them a support engineer said i can try to delete the space entirely hoping that would get me access to my funds again, and it worked.Since then i have filed a complaint with N26, they responded citing ""compliance check"" as the reason. Compliance check that lasted for 3-4 months? Really? I am not trusting N26 with any of my money at this point and moving to a different bank when i get the opportunity.","Hey Evgeny, Thanks for providing your feedback. We are sorry to hear about your issues with our app and the Spaces functionality. In accordance with European banking regulations, N26 must carry out routine technical checks on customer accounts. As a regulated institution, this helps us ensure that the funds held in your N26 account are kept safe and secure.The majority of the time, these checks are done very quickly, without you being able to see them. On occasion, this may take a longer time, during which your account can be temporarily blocked.It seems the issue is solved now but if there's anything else we can look into, please contact us in our social media channels and we'll be happy to advise you further.We're available on Twitter (X) and Instagram via @N26 or on the N26 (DE, AT, CH), N26IT, N26FR or N26 ES Facebook Pages.Best Regards,Bella, Your N26 Support Team.",2024-01-26,2024-01-26,Not Rated,0,2024,Negative
Thomas Lambert,"I've been a metal member for 2 years + now, paying 16â¬ per month, now i've gone down to free, and they deactivated my card, telling me i had to order (and thus pay) for a new one !!!! first they've been reducing more and more the benefits, but most importantly they charge soooo much for everything, i left a ""traditional"" banc for this because i thought it was expensive, well, i can tell you, it was not. Here in spain banks are not allowed to charge for failed debits, and N26 does charge 9â¬ every time. Which for me has been a total of over 200â¬ in those 2 years. I've been able to get the money back, but it's a painful and legal process each time. I strogly recommend staying AWAY from them.","Hey Thomas,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Ken Walsh,"I signed up for N26 as an alternative to my main high street bank. I've had a Revolut account since 2018 and having read generally good things about N26 I decided to sign upThe initial process was seamless and all was good until I started reading into t&c and first thing that caused me to wonder why did I bother: You pay 3% on deposits except for the first deposit, generally I would use this card for day to day expenses and over a year that would be about 20k in Euros which means I'm paying N26 a minimum of â¬600 just for using their bank.Thanks but I pass.Next problem was that I'm limited to depositing â¬450 per month using the top up method on my debit card. Again no thanks I will pass. Your site say Bank Transfers can take up to 5 days to process, why? The longest wait I've experienced was 12 hours from my high street bank account to my Revolut card which normally takes a few hours. Lastly a company sent funds to my account which according to them is instant and yet it shows up on my page on N26 as processing and u cannot give me a definite answer on when this process will complete. So having signed up tested your card and it's offerings it's a BIG NO from me to N26.","Hey Ken,Thanks for providing your feedback. N26 accounts support incoming and outgoing instant and regular SEPA transfers and it's possible to top up your account for free with a transfer.

HH,"Horror experience - not like it is a dishonest bank or something but it is so disfunctional that I would not trust them with garbage, much less my money. Here is a list of my experience, it is actually longer but I stopped counting how often and where they failed me: 1. I applied for your account but had problem doing the identity verification (did it like 3 times and was eventually called by your service representative who did it)2. It took 1-2 weeks to get an answer and when I spoke to your online chat agent (real person not bot), I was informed in the chat that my application had been rejected.3. A week later I got an email informing me the account had been opened. By then I had opened an account in another bank that actually worked and I had not needed to spend 5-6 hours over 4 different occasions to try and open an account with your extremely rigid services.4. I de-registerred from the Premium service.5. I tried to close my n26 account by talking to your chat service and he told me how but said he had to disconnect because I could not do it when he was connected. He left (this was the 5th time I needed to spend a long time trying to fix something in your impossible services) and after I could not close the account because I think it was so new. So that customer service representative mis-informed me (not the first time)6. Recently, I got a notice that my account with n26 was in minus 10 euro even though I had tried to close my account and I had closed my Premium account.","Hey,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Khoi Doan,"I recently had an exasperating experience trying to cancel my N26 Smart account. The entire process is unnecessarily convoluted and time-consuming, a stark contrast to the modern and user-friendly image that N26 usually projects. Firstly, initiating the cancellation requires chatting with customer support, which, in itself, is a process that could be streamlined.After the initial chat, I received a message through the app, requiring yet another round of responses. This back-and-forth communication seems redundant and only serves to prolong the process. What truly tested my patience was the waiting period following these steps; it took several days for the department responsible for cancellations to respond and finalize my request.For a banking service that prides itself on efficiency and customer satisfaction, this cumbersome cancellation process is a significant drawback. It's disheartening to see such a lapse in service, especially in a crucial customer-facing process like account cancellation. N26 needs to address and simplify this procedure to ensure a smoother, more respectful experience for customers wishing to discontinue their services.","Hey Khoi,We are sorry to hear that this process has been frustrating for you and we appreciate the feedback.

All direct debits have been cancelled and I also am unable to draw out any cash. It's scandalous that my money is being held for ransom.The support team is utterly useless they are not even able to speak to the team who is looking into my case. No contact number and no email address. I hope that by writing this review other people will not have to experience what I have. There are better banks out there.Response to N26 reply:The creditor has sent you the information requested via fax 3 times and once via email. I have confirmed the correct fax details were used and that there was no issues with the fax not being delivered. The support process is completely useless not fit for purpose. My case has been escalated multiple times yet I receive no updates other than they are still waiting for a fax.

Laura M.,"N26 has blocked the access to my own account (and a good amount of money) for over a month now without any explanation / reason and (above all) without any solution.The account was blocked after a very simple request to update my contact details (phone number).In the last month I contacted the customer services multiple times with absolutely no help whatsoever and no clarification. They would just reply that they will escalated the issue to some other department and you would never hear from them anymore.I am giving 1 star just because I cannot give less. A bank that does not allow you to access your own money at all times it's worthless. Nothing else matter if that basic service is not guaranteed.Thanks God I have another bank account with some other saving on it because if I was relying simply on N26 account (like some people might do) I would be in the middle of the road with my kids.Edited as I can't answer to the reply: I am not a potential customer, I am a current customer (and have been for 3 years) that has over 40k euro in your bank that I cannot access!!

Mark Genney,"It's funny because N26 just sent me a survey and at the end suggested I leave a review with Trustpilot. So here goes. I have had no issue with N26 since I opened my account maybe 5 years ago. A couple of months ago I got an email telling me that I needed to keep my personal details up to date. I want to make it 100% clear. I am fine with compliance. Especially for a bank.I updated most of my details and all looked good. However I am unable to upload my ID card. The app errors out. It says please try later but it has not worked since the end of November.I did contact customer services and was asked to run through multiple troubleshooting steps. You people wrote the error message so I presume you know what the error message means. I don't think it is my job to troubleshoot your app and run through arbitrary and generic processes. You know exactly what the problem is so fix it. Or...I know I am not the only person to have this issue. There is clearly a broader problem with your app that it is trying to collect compliance information and N26 has done a poor job of coding it. So why not let CS reps gather that information when people contact you about it? I cannot upload my ID to the app in your compliance section but I can attach a file to the customer services chat. N26 was not my main bank so I withdrew my funds so as to not lose access. Sure enough, about a month later at the end of December I got a message saying that access to my account had been restricted. So that's that. I no longer have an active unrestricted N26 account. Not because there was anything wrong with it. Only because they were compelled to gather compliance information. They chose to do this exclusively via the portal in their app, and they suck a programming so their app didn't work.Edit after N26 reply: I don't know if N26 is cutting and pasting replies but my review has nothing to do with any chargeback and I didn't ask for customer services to overturn a senior team's decision. I swear these people make things worse by trying to engage with clients via Trustpilot.Edit after second N26 reply: I see they deleted their earlier irrelevant reply and updated it. But the link sent also has nothing to do with my review. I do not have a problem with my card. I have a problem with the app that won't even let me upload my card. 1. I log into the app2. I get directed to the ""confirm your information"" page. It says ""Restrictions have been applied to your account. To remove them, confirm your details""3.

Sarah A,"I found 3 fraud charges on my N26 account one morning and immediately canceled the card and reported it. I was on the free account, so there was literally no other option for contacting CS besides sending a message. It took them 3 weeks to reply, and their reply was that as far as they can tell, I authorized the charges. Mind you, this whole incident occurred shortly AFTER they sent me a new card in the mail, stating that they had experienced a data leak. I keep very little money in this account (thank god), and these fraud charges were of the amounts 600 EUR, 680 EUR, and 480 EUR from something called ""CONCEPTAL."" The second and third charges didn't go through due to insufficient funds. It's such an obvious fraud case, I didn't even worry at first - surely they know that they have a security breach and that these charges are obviously fraud.I keep most of my money in Citi bank, and on the rare occasion something like this happens, Citi either blocks it and notifies me, or I dispute it and they send a refund. NOT the case with N26. I had to sign up for some premium account to even be able to call CS, and the guy was incredibly rude - his solution was that I should ""go report it to the police"" and ""feel free to look into competitor banks"" if I don't like the way N26 handles fraud charges. It's clear the bank is failing - in a matter of years it went from great service to paid everything: No more cards issued for free, no CS calls for free, no fraud refunds. I'm now setting up an account with a different bank (as the CS guy recommended!) and looking forward to closing my account with N26 once and for all. Stay away from this place; your money is definitely NOT safe with them.","Hey Sarah, Thank you for providing details of the case.Our Chargeback team investigate disputes using the Mastercard Chargeback Guide.

TrustCrashPilot,"I think that N26 has gone down in quality. I was quite pleased until a few months ago.I was victim of phishing; N26 made me submit all the info around 3 times, only to tell me that they would not be able to help me. I also needed to cancel 2 direct debits at short notice (having unsuccessfully tried  twice to cancel the subscription directly with the merchant who failed to respond twice) but N26 makes this as complicated as possible: With other banks this is just a click on their app or Website, but with N26 I need to download a paper (!) form, fill this in, sign it, scan it, email it back and hope it gets actioned in time. Why, if  I can for example do a bank transfer directly on the app without needing to send a paper form, why not allow the same for cancelling direct debits?","Hey,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Joshua,"Pros: I have been n26 client since 2018. Back then it was the only bank which can offer me an account since I am a foreigner in Germany. I have used it when I travelled to Asia or outside of EU. The card has never been rejected as long as Mastercard is accepted. The online transactions are normal. The exchange rate is market rate. No hidden fees. Cons: the Wise transfer n26 cooperates with had caused me trouble as I wanted to transfer money to Asia. There was some issues with the final transfer fees. I paid everything in n26. One day I suddenly received an email from Wise transfer informing me I didnât pay enough fees, which I found ridiculous. I was using the service within the app. Then n26 should have been in charge of fixing it. Besides, by using this n26 function, an account was created in Wise transfer by default. I tried to fix it with n26 but I was informed this is not their business. Beside this, n26 didnât offer good saving plans compared with Klarna.In general I am quite happy with n26. At the same time I am also looking for a better alternative bank for saving account with high interest.",Pending,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,Not Rated,0,2023,Positive

After I read all of that I had this feeling that they are not like a real bank, that they give a false sense of security and it's only a matter of time until they do that to me and steal my funds, so I thought to myself there is no chance I put my life's savings only to get them stolenl, so I got my money back to my main bank account and closed N26 account immediately.","Hey Antonio, Thanks for your feedback. There are many reasons why an account may be blocked or closed. This would include improper usage of the account, a serious breach of the T&Cs, or any behaviour that goes against the general rules of conduct set between the customer and the bank. As a licensed bank, we would never block an account without a valid reason. In accordance with European banking regulations, N26 must carry out routine technical checks on customer accounts. As a regulated institution, this helps us ensure that the funds held in your N26 account are kept safe and secure.

First they implied that it was my fault, as someone had to have had access to my profile, one time pin, etc. There was no one time pin even! That's how fraud happens, right? Someone has intercepted the process. But they are not interested. Now they have told me I must investigate it with the police or the merchant. The merchant??? There is no merchant! That's the point! It went to an unknown account! This is where I expect the bank to take an interest and see where they can improve security to prevent this happening to their clients, and to reimburse me of course! But it seems their approach is simple - we don't care. Which means that this is simply not a safe institution to bank with. No way. I'm lucky it was only 100 euros - if I hadn't seen it happens, I would have no money left in the account and the bank would still say we don't care.","Hey Lindi, Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Jurij Novak,"I have been a regular customer of N26 since November 2019 and before this happened, I had never had any problems. Even when I lost the card, their support was fast and efficient.For unknown reasons, this all changed 2 weeks ago. For security reasons (in order not to lose the phone), I kept the N26 application on my old phone, Samsung S5. It suddenly refused to enter application, claiming that it needed to be updated. However, the update failed and it was not available. Customer service (very quick and responsive) advised me to switch to new phone which I did but then numerous problems started. I had no more old phone number from 2019 because I have lived abroad since and in different countries. Customer service advised me to make a transaction with my card which was not possible because I am currently visiting relatives in an area without access to ATM whatsoever and not to mention also in a problematic country. (However, I do have access to broadband internet.) So the entire account was reset and the customer service said that a new identification with video call would be made. I went into application to have it done, however no video call was available, only some kind of automatic verification which works very very poorly. It asked me to take photo of my password which is luckily the same as in 2019 when I opened the account and then to look into camera and turn my head. The application kept closing and I needed at least 30 minutes to finish the required procedures. Next day I got the email saying:Weâve reviewed the information you provided and we must inform you that according to our current verification procedures, weâre unable to offer you an N26 bank account at this time.I did not apply for new account but only for identity verification to access the old one!I contacted customer service immediately the next day. The agent was very nice and polite and told me that she would escalate my case and that I should try again in few days. I asked about how long would this take as in 3 weeks I was planning to travel back to Europe and would prefer not to borrow cash from my relatives (which is now becoming the only option to solve my financial problems!). She said to check back in a few days. I did check with customer service after an entire week and got the reply that my case ""was still under investigation"". Investigation of what? I only changed my phone because the application on the old one stopped working. I requested in-person video verification of my identity and only got an automatic one which clearly does not work. (I can try again and hope for the best.) I have never received or done any suspicious transaction, all this ordeal is only due to a software glitch. I can continue bothering customer service but each time I chat with different person anyway and it seems that they are unable to help me at all. My impression is that nothing has been done at all. I can try email too. I don't know what to do, the situation is next to ridiculous (being locked out of the account due to software update no longer being available which created a domino of unfortunate events). If this problem persists for another 2 weeks, I really see no other choice than to take legal action because this is clearly a violation of EU and German regulations on consumer protection and financial services. At least I should be granted the option to close the account and getting my money back. This is all very regrettable because before this I had had only excellent experience with N26 and would rate it 5-star.Customer service is nevertheless quick, responsive and very polite, but my impression was that they had no power to help in such cases as mine.N26 is great but I would advice some safety precautions. If possible, have an application on a separate phone which you keep at home. (In case that your mobile phone is stolen or lost, procedure becomes a nightmare.) However, this phone should not be too old because the app can stop working due to unavailable updates. Also, if you move around a lot (e.g. as a digital nomad), you should keep a permanent mobile phone number in your home country with a relative or friend and use this number to register. As soon as you lose your phone or number or both, the issue becomes very difficult.I am reaching desperation. If somebody from N26 is reading this, please give me some useful advice how to continue and we can hopefully go back to good old days when I was not locked out of my account.

Alberto,"I have been with n26 for 3+ years. I have joined in mid 2020 and here I am at the end of 2023 to give the feedback that they deserve. I have used the account as a rainy deposit one where I was moving some cash around, overall I think less than 1 transfer every 2 month. Then, from September 2023 I have used it more actively.Shortly I had a few issues, on mid-October with my outgoing transfers being locked (standard procedure) as the mail support service said (not the chat operator). They locked my outgoing transactions as I made a transfer of around 10 grands. Saying that this is a standard procedure that they do apply to ensure that the money are legit. Pity that few months before I had transfer more than that with no issues.Anyway, after that first red flag I decided to give them another opportunity as the laws may have changed and despite was a bit annoying to have my transfers locked I could still use the card for day-to-day groceries.Today however, I got my free card delivered as I am (well, was) a premium member of n26 smart.My idea was to have two physical different cards that were linked to different spaces.Nevertheless, as soon as I activated the newly childish coloured card, my old  one got deactivated and I was left with a childish card instead of the transparent card given to the free member.Now, this was not advertised on the website nor in the app âpremium membership featuresâ and not even in the pdf sent as contract.That was the second red flag, but maybe I missed out a third contract and I felt into their fishy adverting.The 3rd (and last) red flag was when the guy through chat told me that I COULD NOT get the card given to the free member cause I was on a premium membership. I mean, I was willing to pay the fee to get it delivered but despite that I could not get the transparent (embossed) card.The third flag was enough for myself to move out all my money and get the refund for the premium membership, letâs see if they fulfil the reimbursement.My choice has been to drop off from n26 at all before having some more serious matter to discuss.Oh one more thing, less than a week ago I have been able to transfer more than 10k euro in a single transfer to an iban that I had never done any transfer before and guess what? No checking there. So apparently the law to verify that transfer are legit was up just in October.Just be aware of their fishy advertisement.In response to n26 reply:If you start paying me I could have a few feedbacks but I do not see why I should spend my time to provide feedbacks to let your company make a profit.Anyway, given that I truly could not find any clause in the contract stating that the new card would replace the existing one, would you be so kind to provide here publicly the information? So anyone that would read this message could go and see the clauses.","Hey Alberto, Thank you for the detailed feedback. Being able to keep the card related to another membership is a good suggestion.

Thirdi,"Between 2018 and 2023, the standard debit card and account functioned reasonably well, despite occasional challenges with customer service. However, transitioning to the Slate ""Business Card"" and going back to a regular debit card to opt out of monthly fees brought about changes. Unfortunately, reverting to a regular debit card is no longer an option, and N26 has introduced fees for the use of their traditional debit card services, making simple transactions, like ATM withdrawals and online purchases, less convenient.Choosing the Slate ""Business Card"" comes with limitations, notably the absence of a return pathway to a standard debit card. Additionally, the introduction of fees for regular services may disrupt the user experience. Users are now directed towards a ""digital debit card,"" requiring the utilization of features like CASH26 for in-store cash withdrawals, and some online purchases may encounter limitations. This shift in services might present inconveniences compared to the earlier, more straightforward usage of the regular debit card and account from 2018 to 2023.","Hey Thirdi,Thank you for the review.

Ayda,"Untrustworthy as hell. That's the only comment I have to make. Living in a country where we take money and privacy and security seriously, being the most secure country in terms of banking, N26 is the worst thing ever for any swiss citizen. I usually never write reviews and I am comprehensive of entrepreneurs due to my own situation, but this company is terrible. Awful and terrible. They use any tricks to steal your money, impeach you transfer it. Then, when you write nicely to their support, they lie or they leave the chat abruptly. They can maintain a conversation without saying anything helpful. They are uneducated people, who cannot have basic respect for their clients. It's awful.Lying to a client by writing specifically after verification that the transfer was made but actually it did not happen at all, and then talking to someone who leaves the chat abruptly without waiting for me to reply, then talking to someone else who spends minutes writing without saying anything helpful, but how can you even pretend to be a banking institution with a behavior like this? I am not the only one who apparently experienced this with your app, but many of us did. All the reviews say the same thing, and I should have read them before opening an account.There's nothing worse than LYING to a client when we pretend to be a banking institution. If I were buying at Zara and the shopping assistant lied to me, I would not care, but at a banking institution, this is not acceptable at all.I did try to reverse my payment that was not the issue and you know it. THE ISSUE IS THAT YOU LIED TO ME in your LIVE CHAT.You are a banking institution and you LIE to your clients? Can you understand how angry they can be? I speak politely, but apparently lying and mocking your customers it is how you reply to them when they are nice. The fact that you can't even present your excuses or actually recognize this part of my comment says the true nature and identity of N26, thank you.Is it possible for N26 to be honest? I mean, is that a possible outcome for this company or is it impossible? I hope you will not interfere with the automatic retransfer of my money, because that will annoy me  even more. I wait to see their reaction and if they are different to what they pretend but looking at their tricks and how they reply and modify their message, I am truly interested in to see the outcome of this knowing how much they are full guilty in my case.","Hey Ayda, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. Thank you for the details. Please note we can't reverse a payment confirmed in the app. We would need to open a payment investigation. You can find confirmed payments on the downloadable balance statement.

Adri Lueiro,"Where to start? - They say they don't charge fees but they charge absurd amounts. For example 9 EUR for overdraft. - While their competitors (Wise, Revolut) pay you interest for your money, they don't offer that. Correction: Apparently they do offer that. Still low interest rates compared to Revolut 3.08% APY in EUR (even higher with paid plans) or Wise 3.62%- Customer support is disrespectful and condescending. When asked politely to waive the overdraft fee, they lectured me saying things like ""You should read your contract, that's what they're for, enforce them"" or ""I already explained your T&C, in life we must have responsibilities""","Hey Adri,Thanks for the report.We're sorry for any issues with a live chat agent.A 9â¬ fee sounds like it is for a missed Direct Debit, this is different to an overdraft fee.

John B.,"I'm appalled at how utterly useless this bank has become - when I opened the account five years ago they were very good and efficient - I could actually talk to customer service and submit a contact form - all that has gone, and it's like a lot of online businesses staffed by utterly clueless individuals who don't read what you are typing and have no answers. I spent a considerable amount of time today explaining to two different customer service people that my new card was being rejected by shops and I couldn't get any money out of a cash machine - they both claimed to have reset the card but absolutely nothing was fixed meaning I had to transfer all the money in the N26 to another account that works - their system would not let me do this via instant transfer meaning it will take one or two days - so I also had to do a  foreign exchange transfer to the other account to tide me over. Really really annoying - I will probably now close the N26 account - I would not recommend them.","Hey John, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

S Patricia,"1/25/2024 Update #3N26 is now suing me for 43.5 euros for fees incurred because the account was not closed properly when they did not follow up, as they stated they would in their documentation.  I am paying it because I don't want it to show up in my credit report, but it is a huge injustice.  It's a cost they could have eaten especially given I attempted four times to provide the ID validation they required back in August of 2023 but that their software did not support and then was left 10 days with no access to my account.  This entire thing was their fault, from start to finish, and no one has taken responsibility for it.  I recently reached out to the MD here in Spain and no reply.  Terrible, terrible customer service for a company that wants to position itself as progressive and client focused. It was an opportunity to do the right thing and build a solid reputation for their company but, instead, I'm the one who ends up paying (financially and in time wasted) for their incompetence, unprofessionalism and lack of empathy for the client.   12/11/2023 Update #2Just received another email from your bank, Peter, and still nothing from you.  I even checked my Spam and you weren't there either.  I'm not the one who messed up the really great banking relationship we had, you guys did.  Please stop sending me emails threatening to come after me for what is now 36 Euros of fees you've added on once my account was emptied and closed.  Do you really want this bad publicity?11/20/2023 Update #1I just received another threatening email from N26 about not closing my account and sending my unpaid fees (20euros?) for debt collection.  Come on, N26.  Do you really want to continue this type of customer service?  The day after I posted my review below, I was contacted by Trustpilot to make my email address available to Peter so that I could be contacted directly.  It looks good on the website, but I was never contacted.  Peter, please close my account and stop sending me threatening emails.  Surely, your engineering team can disable an account without all this drama.  Original CommentI used to love this bank.  I joined in 2020 and told everyone I knew how great and easy it was to use.  Then in July this year (2023) I was asked to verify my ID.  Since my passport had expired the system was not accepting it but it didn't give me an option to explain the change.  I had to spend countless hours with the customer service staff who tried their absolute best to help me, making all kinds of promises that the engineering team were handling everything and that I shouldn't worry.  I had uploaded my new passport ID manually and they assured me that I had met the deadline (early August) to avoid having my account disabled.  I told them I would be traveling internationally and it would not be good if I did not have access to my funds during that trip.  Again, a thousand assurances that they knew what was going on, the engineers were working on the so-called bug and that I would not have my account disabled.  Well, you can guess what happened.  Just as they promised in their initial communications when the request came out for ID verification, they disabled my account after the August deadline and for 10 days I could not access my own funds while on the road.  Normally, I can be forgiving when a new company is getting established and I'm one of the guinea pigs/customers helping them cut their teeth on their technology, etc.  But for a BANK to do something like this, it's absolutely unforgiveable.  It's a real shame as I'm a big fan of doing anything and everything online when it can be done but this, unfortunately, was a bad gamble for me.  I'll never trust them again and hope that someone takes them over so that they can have some real leadership on the engineering side so this doesn't happen to anyone else - although I did see here on Trustpilot that there are quite a few unhappy former customers.  When I finished my travels and came home, I moved my money out and followed the instructions to close my account and, as expected, the email I was supposed to receive days later did not arrive to confirm closure so when some auto debits hit, they charged a fee/multiple fees.  When I called to complain, the absolutely clueless rep told me that they couldn't close the account until I paid the fees.  The nerve.  There was no way I was giving them anymore money.  A very sad ending to what started as a positive banking relationship.  If you're reading this contemplating whether or not to take the risk and become a customer, I would encourage you to take your risks elsewhere.  When it comes to being able to access your money and not have a branch/office to go to or someone to call when they've made a stupid mistake like they did with me, you'd be better off with a more established and reliable entity.","Hey Patricia, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.We apologise for any issues with the verification of your account.

JesÃºs Nebreda GalÃ­ndez,"If I could I would give them minus 10 stars! This ""bank"" cancels people's accounts without reason, notice period or real investigation. They cancelled my account when I was travelling outside Europe and NEVER explained why (that is absolutely illegal). They ruined my holiday, sent my case to a debt collection agency (which I paid directly) even though I asked for a way to pay my overdraft and they never gave it to me. Not content with that, they keep asking me for more money, a never ending nightmare. The worst decision of my life was to trust this bank for my salary, etc.... If I could go back in time, I would run away from them. I have reported them to the Deutsches Bundesbank.","Hey JesÃºs, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Valentina Leonor,"Great onboarding, awful offboarding.I had to close my account, on advice from N26. I moved from Spain to Germany, and because I didn't hold a Spanish ID anymore I was advised to close the account and re-open it from Germany, no biggie. But so far the offboarding has been terrible.Opening an N26 account was easy and using it was amazing, I loved the UX and the money spaces. BUT 1- while closing (it took a while and it was never clear on my side what was happening or for how long) I discovered that my nationality is not accepted in N26 Germany, so I can't return to N26. I only received a message to ""keep coming back to their documents, as my country might get added someday"" Uhmm thanks, all great pieces of advice so far. 2- When closing, I had outstanding money in my account from the cancelation of my N26 membership and a transfer that arrived too late, they asked for an IBAN to get that money back but... it's been more than 2 weeks. Late replies, nobody knows how long it will take, what's the process.","Hey Valentina, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Christian Schnepf,"Works generally well within one country and with phone. Yet, as they claim to be a travel bank itâs little to recommend. Durning travel it happens sometimes that there is no access to the phone or as recently in my case, that the phone gets damaged. In that case there is no way to have access to money as payments need to be confirmed via phone. The attempt to find a solution with the customer service is also little problem solving as they do not understand that the phone is not available and just refer back and back to âI need a phoneâ. For travelling and international living very disappointing. Also in case the credit card gets lost or has to be blocked for any reason, they cannot deliver a new card to counties outside the EU, leaving me without card and no access to the money in their bank. Such situations can be already stressful enough, but the customer support for (re-) registration is unfortunately very bad. 6 out of 6 service employees started the call incredibly annoyed and unfriendly and hang up the moment they could not answer a question.In total: great for domestic living and occasional travels abroad if no other incident occurs. Strongly not to recommend for living abroad or frequent travels.","Hey Christian, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We are sorry to hear about the situation you faced in your trip.The mobile device is always needed for the access to your account, as it provides an extra security step, to keep your account and your money safe.

Gordana Ivetic,"I just signed up for this bank so not a lot of experience with them but so far the positives are:- They have readily available customer service in English via chat in the free standard version-It was easy to open the account - it took maybe 10 minutes-The app is completely in English so it is accessible to us expats in GermanyNegatives:-There should be a way to access the bank account on my laptop without my phone as what concerns me is the fact that the phone can be lost/stolen and then you have a big problem of not being able to access your bank account without one. So I hope that they will consider making that option available, as I already read reviews of people who experienced this. -I couldn't top up my account with my existing visa card even though there is an option to do it - it just didn't work.","Hello Gordana!Thanks so much for taking the time to leave us a 3 - star rating â it's much appreciated!Best, Zayn - N26 Support Team.",2023-10-24,2023-10-24,Not Rated,0,2023,Positive
Michael Liendl,"I have been a loyal customer of N26 since 2015, but my recent experience has led me to reconsider my choice. N26 offered me what was ambiguously termed a ârepayment plan,â implying it would help organize my overdraft repayments. Unfortunately, this misleading âserviceâ has severely damaged my credit score.When I approached customer support for clarity and a resolution, I was met with deflection and blame-shifting. âIt's your fault,â they said, making no attempt to rectify the issue or reinstate my original overdraft limit.Furthermore, N26's services have deteriorated over the years, losing the edge that once made them stand out. Features that were initially unique to N26, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, are now widely offered by competitors who also provide far superior customer support.In light of this dismal experience, I strongly recommend opening an account with another institution that respects its customers and doesn't ruin their credit under the guise of âhelping.â","Hey Michael, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. The repayment plan is offered for your account if the overdraft is cancelled or you need more than two months to repay your negative amount.Once the repayment plan is activated, the overdraft is cancelled and cannot be activated again, until the full overdraft amount is paid.

Josh Stern,"I opened my N26 account when I moved to Denmark. N26 advertises itself as being available in Denmark. To my surprise once the account was created I was issued an IBAN... but it was for Germany. After enquiring about this I was told ""Its IBAN Discrimination"" by my firm if they wont accept it. Having a German IBAN in Denmark makes everything much tougher when getting banking done. Then I never received the physical card I was supposed to get, but BE SURE THAT N26 Continued to charge me for its ""premium"" account service. Finally i got tired of waiting after a few months and went to close my account. The Customer Service Reps response was that I still had 10 Euros in the account and I would have to transfer everything off the account prior to closing it.... So in short they wanted me to pay a exchange rate fee to them to transfer the money off my account (Which btw took days rather than minutes/seconds).Having then requested again that the account be closed when that 10 Euros was used up they still didnt do this. All in all I ended up being charged for multiple months that I didnt use or could even use for a service that was nonexistent. I am not thrilled and have reported them to Ba-Fin in Germany. PS: I also had a USA N26 account when I lived there for a while.... That was also terrible. I should have learned my lesson already then. All in All N26 is a horrid firm and I will never be using them again. So stupid considering providers in the UK were so strong. (Monzo, Revolut etc... make N26 look like Childs play.)","Hey Josh, Thank you for taking the time to leave your detailed review. We are sorry to hear that your experience with our bank wasn't as expected.All the accounts created in N26 have a German IBAN. However, some of our supported countries have their unique IBANs, like Spain (ES), Italy (IT) and France (FR). Some merchants or employers don't accept IBANs from other member countries when setting up account transactions, such as direct debits and salary transfers. This usually isn't done with bad intentions. They may simply be misinformed, or technically unable to accept IBANs of different formats as they're using outdated user interfaces. Please find more information on our support centre: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/payments-transfers-and-withdrawals/direct-debits-and-standing-orders/what-to-do-if-my-n26-iban-is-not-acceptedRegarding your card, once your account is upgraded, a premium card is sent to your shipping address. If your card is lost in the post office or your shipping address is not filled correctly in the app, then the delivery of the card will fail. In this case, you need to contact us via live chat, if more than 10 business days have passed, and we'd be glad to reorder it for you.Also, we can close an account only if the remaining balance is zero. You can proceed with a SEPA transfer of your funds to another account, as this type of transaction has no fees at all. Once the remaining balance is zero, then you can contact us again, in order to proceed with the cancellation of your account.Please keep in mind that once the account is upgraded, you are benefited by all the advantages the membership plan can provide. As a result, the membership plan remains active and if you decide to downgrade your account back to the standard plan, we can proceed with this action by informing us with a chat. Also, you can use your virtual card for your account until the physical card arrives and have all the advantages of your premium account.If you feel that these charges shouldn't be applied to your account, you can open a visitor chat with us and make a formal complaint or you can send us a message in our address complaints@n26.com .

Gordon,"I have a paid service with them, ""Smart"". They gave me a hotline number and everything.I was happy with them until they suddenly decided to review my transactions, giving me a time limit in which to give a response.The reason they gave for the review is that they require it because their policy requires it (so they decided to need it?).I responded immediately.I had significant money in the account, which I removed the next day, because I cannot have confidence in them.Will they be de-bank me?Who knows?Irish Banks are a complete joke, so N26 was a breath of fresh air - or so I thought - but in fairness to AIB and BOI, as much as I hate them, they wouldn't do what N26 is doing to me.There customer service is completely useless in this situation. I have no one I can ask questions to, and they have me locked into a contract for a service that they have decided to make worthless.I can't set up the further bill payments that I need, as I have no idea if they will allow the account to exist next week. They have never outlined the consequence for not providing the requested information, or why they are treating me like a criminal.They want receipts that I do not have.Also, I doubt it is a coincidence that they are requesting receipts on purchases from Europa Bullion, a precious metals dealer. That is a complete invasion of privacy.Perhaps they are fearful of a bank collapse?Furthermore, despite the nature of the requests, they only send information via there platform, and not to my email.That means I have no copy of the interactions, and N26 have power over it. If I want to take legal action, that puts me on the back foot.Totally unfair, and unjust behaviour from them.(Check their reply: makes no sense)","Hey, Gordon Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Jake Zywiol,I don't understand why N26 takes so ridiculously long to process transactions in foreign currencies. It often takes over 48 hours for a 'processing' transaction to actually become available in my account.

Victoria,"I became a victim of a scam, resulting in the unauthorized transfer of â¬290 from my account via Send app somewhere to Nigeria. Immediately upon discovering this fraudulent activity, I contacted N26 to report the incident and initiated the process to request a chargeback. However, to my dismay, after a prolonged MORE THAN month-long investigation, my chargeback request was denied.The denial of my chargeback request has left me deeply troubled for several reasons:Questionable Legal Stance: The denial letter stated that ""Mastercard cannot dispute the transaction/s,"" citing reasons that seem to be based on N26's interpretation of the situation: I payed to a third-pary app, SendApp believing it was Vinted. However, the circumstances surrounding this transaction raise concerns about the legality of such a stance. A bank agent has confirmed me that he was able to track the recipient of the money, that was an account from NIGERIA. It is my belief that N26, as a financial institution, has a duty to protect its customers from fraudulent activities, and not NEGLECT fraud.Breach of Trust: As a loyal N26 customer, I have placed my trust in this institution to provide support in the event of unauthorized transactions or human factor or falling for scamsters. The denial of my chargeback request feels like a breach of that trust, and it casts doubt on the bank's commitment to protecting all customers from fraud.Failure to Address Fraud: The denial implies that N26 has washed its hands off this case, leaving me to deal with the consequences of a fraudulent transaction on my own. This not only places an undue burden on me but also reflects poorly on the bank's dedication to addressing fraud-related issues.I ask N26 to reconsider your decision and review my case with a fresh perspective. I genuinely believe that this is a clear case of fraud, and I trust that N26 will take the necessary steps to rectify the situation promptly.I value my relationship with N26 and would like to see this matter resolved amicably. Please let me know how we can work together to address this issue and restore my confidence in the bank's commitment to its customers' security and well-being.Sincerely,Victoria","Hello Victoria, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Kevin K,"I had heard good things about N26 so we applied for a business account. When it got to the identification verification step on the app we provided all the necessary information. It said they received it and then there was just silence for over a week. No request for additional information, no follow up or updates on what we submitted, just finally a message saying they could not validate the information we submitted so they cancelled our account. Even though we provided everything they need. I signed up for a business account for other markets with 2 different online banks and it was no problem. We were approved within 48 hours. Those signup processes were also much simpler and the communication throughout the process was SO much better. I don't even know if N26 had a problem with the proofs or if they never even looked at them. This happened 2 times already so time to find an online option that is actually of decent quality that wants business. Strange how bad their communication and the overall experience was. I suggest not wasting your time with them.*Updated based on their reply: I see A LOT of reviews here that they are unable to provide more information on why an account was not accepted. That seems to happen a lot, particularly when other banks accepted our proofs (passport, articles of incorporation, NIE numbers, etc.) with no problem. Once again, don't waste your time to avoid dealing with canned responses like this one. It was a similar experience reaching out to their customer support team when I was not hearing back. I connected with an agent finally via chat. I explained the problem, she came back, said she could not see any information, and ended the chat with no notice or even saying thanks or goodbye. Not the kind of bank I want by my side!","Hey Kevin, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Pistol Pete,"I have applied, using the same documents as another web-bank (Wise). They have turned down my application. Tried to contact support, same standard meaningless, unprofessional answer.They come up with vague excuses about banking regulations which is pure bullocks. Not professional, not reliable, stay away.Update on 14/9/2023Now they communicate that it is linked to an identification error. As an ID error is mostly related to their systems, or my input, did they blatantly lie and used the first ""handy, cover-all excuse"" that exists?

AS,"UPDATE: They closed the bank account suddenly after writing this review and tried to steal my money. Watch out for these scoundrels!Expensive and useless, absolutely no value for money. It used to be OK years ago, but now competition has eaten them up.Moreover, you can see from their reply below that they keep lying about free account, when they actually only offer waitlist for free account and then try to push expensive accounts that have no added value instead to avoid waitlist. They don't even pay interest for savings, and if you keep in your account over 50.000 eur, they take a percentage from your money just for holding it there while other neobanks are paying at the same time 3-5% intrests for your savings depending on currency.It is a miracle if this bank still exists in 2024.","Hi there, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

This means that it didn't happened only to me, next could be You....Google ""businessinsider"" + ""N26""Can't give the link directly here-----------------------------------------------------------Another news from the net;German Online Bank Closes the Accounts of Over 100 Clients, Who Claim They Still Have Gotten Their Money Back.German neobank headquartered in Berlin, Germany, N26, has closed the online bank accounts of over one hundred customers, without prior warning, as a part of anti-fraud measures that went wrong a month ago, in April 14. N26 clients have been suddenly blocked from accessing their savings, and several of them have told the Business insider, Including here a Ukrainian refuge, that they still havenât gotten their money back yet.According to a press release issued by N26 on April 19, in which it is explained why the bank accounts of some of its clients are sometimes closed, as a fully regulated bank N26 has a legal requirement to combat financial crime.âN26 regularly conducts routine checks on our millions of customer accounts to detect suspicious activity or misuse of accounts, which allow us to monitor and flag suspicious activity or misuse where it may exist,â the press release reads.It further goes on to explain that the bank, in spite of not being a traditional one, is obliged by law to report to the German Financial Intelligence Unit by filing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) in cases when suspicious activity is detected.âSometimes, our findings may require us to block accounts. We always aim to return any customer funds as soon as possible as long as these can be released,â the statement reads.It, however, acknowledges that not all decisions to block bank accounts are 100 per cent right, insisting that the N26 team does everything possible in order to minimize the margin for error.The decision to block the bank accounts of some of its clients has affected many, including a Ukrainian refuge named Anya Shamaieva, who told the Business Insider that she had about â¬15,000 in her account, and she had hoped to support herself with that money while the war in her home ranged on.When she contacted N26 regarding the reason behind the move, she was told that she had to prove the funds were hers in order to get her account unblocked.âI explained that I am displaced, so it may be hard to prove because I didnât bring anything with me. Iâm not able to go to the tax office in Kyiv and risk my life again because N26 decided to close my account,â she said.Others affected by the closure of their bank accounts claim they were left unable to pay their bills, were left unable to go on trips they had planned for months, thus losing money that was already paid, and some of them could not even allocate their employeeâs salaries.------------------------------------------------------------","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

When I asked for the certification from my physical bank and explained what exactly happened with N26 the manager director of the bank brach was shocked .  I am EU resident and all banks that I cooperate they frequently ask information regarding financial and other personal details ,but always they give a time-line. Furthermore more I will complain against N26 to Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin) and i suggest so to other clients that have same issues.","Hi there!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

Zoe Rosa,I tried to opened an account over a month ago. Did the identity verification step successfully and was told that they would get back to me in 2 business days to continue the process. That was a month ago and I have followed up 3 times for the same answer of just wait you will get an email. No email whatsoever not even for the status of the process. Tried to cancel all together and even that has been a hassle. Support chat says to do it through the support email and the support email says to do it through the support chat. I have another online bank account (Wise) and didn't have such a hassle.,"HI there, Thanks for providing your feedback.

While I understand the importance of maintaining accurate information for security and compliance purposes, I would like to communicate my decision regarding providing additional verification for any purpose.

As a result, I kindly request your assistance in closing my account and completing any necessary procedures to finalize this process with removal of all personal data from N26 records.I appreciate your understanding of my situation and your dedication to managing my account.

Daria,"Absolutely dehumanising experience. I tried to open an account for my photography freelance business that I'm currently setting up. I provided the required documents for review, and after four days of zero response (while it's been announced the review is only up to two days) I had to write to the customer service myself. After my enquiry, the agent told me that my request to open the account had been rejected. Firstly, no one even told me about that. Secondly, when I repeatedly asked what was wrong with my application, the agent told me that they cannot provide any details and just dropped off the chat... that left a horrible feeling and I now waisted one week on this bank.

SÅawomir Kelm,"My Name is Slawomir Pawel KELM. I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction and frustration with the recent experience I have had with N26 Bank.   I sold my car in a desperate attempt to settle my debts. I opted to use my N26 Bank Account to receive the proceeds from the car sale, believing that this would be a seamless process. However, what followed has left me in a state of distress and anxiety.After receiving the funds in my N26 account, I initiated a series of transfers to my friends to pay off the debts that had been causing me significant financial strain. To my disbelief, these transfers never arrived at their intended recipients. The lack of clarity and transparency from N26 Bank regarding the status of these transfers only exacerbated my concern.To make matters worse, my N26 Bank Account was subsequently blocked without any prior notice or explanation. This abrupt action has left me in a dire situation, as I am now unable to access the funds that rightfully belong to me and are crucial for settling my debts and regaining financial stability.I find it deeply disheartening that N26 Bank, an institution I once trusted, has put me in this distressing situation without any explanation or resolution. This ordeal has not only caused me severe financial hardship but has also taken a significant toll on my mental and emotional well-being.I implore N26 Bank to urgently investigate the issues related to the failed fund transfers, provide a comprehensive explanation for the account block, and take immediate steps to rectify this situation. I kindly request that the withheld funds be released without further delay so that I can fulfill my obligations and put an end to this agonizing chapter in my life.I believe that it is within the best interests of both parties to resolve this matter promptly and amicably. Failure to address this issue adequately will not only lead to further financial and emotional distress for me but will also tarnish the reputation of N26 Bank as a reliable financial institution.I kindly request a written acknowledgment of this complaint within 3 days and a commitment to addressing and resolving the issues raised . You can contact me anytime  to provide updates and communicate any steps taken to resolve this matter.I hope to see this unfortunate situation rectified promptly and in a manner that restores my trust in N26 Bank.Sincerely,Slawomir Pawel KELM","Hey Slawomir, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Dmitry,"I was really disappointed with the app. I expected to see something new, but all your functions I saw in other banks. Nothing unique.When I created an account I faced a bug, but couldn't make a screenshot, because it wasn't allowed by default.Moreover, using the app I found a lot of limitations, which made me upset. For instance, I can set income sorter and round-up only for the main account. It is not convenient. I also can't open an account in foreign currency. While I was waiting for a plastic card I used a virtual card that was connected to Google pay. When I registered the plastic card in the app you dropped my virtual card. Why did you do it? You made me to add the card to Google pay one more time. I think you spend more money on PR, rather then app and development.As for now I don't satisfied with the app, but hope you'll change it.","Hey Dmitry, Thank you for taking the time to leave this detailed review.At the moment, you can have an account with EUR currency only, but you can still receive and send money in another currency too, from inside your app. However, if you receive money in another currency, the funds are converted into EUR, before reaching your N26 account.Regarding your virtual card, please keep in mind that the activation of your physical card has no impact on your virtual card usage.

I finished the verification twice fully and even sensed my passport to the email address I was given by the support. You can already guess... Nothing happened. I only received 4 emails, asking me to rate the work of the support team. In the end, today, I still do not have any account, I did not receive any help from the support team and my problem was not solved! And even after I decided to stop all of this, because I could not do anything else and decided to open an account at another bank, I wrote an email, which said that I want all of my data to be deleted. Guess what... Still nothing has happened. All in all I am very disappointed!",Pending,2023-08-02,2023-08-02,Not Rated,0,2023,Negative

Antonia Lim,"I was a paid customer for many years and in the end that loyalty meant nothing to N26. I was a victim of phishing and lost a lot of money. The transactions were completely out of the ordinary from my normal spending habits, and the money was taken out of my account without proper authorisation, i.e. confirmation of the payment through the app. After more than a month of investigation, where every message and proof I sent to them took more than a week to get responded to, N26 decided that it was me that took all that money and closed the case. I never saw that money again. N26 doesn't care about you or your money, only their own money. A premium account still means you sit and wait on the phone in a queue. You don't get any preferential treatment, and your money is certainly not safe with them. It's extremely easy for scams and frauds to happen with N26 because they don't have the proper precautions in place to prevent unauthorised transactions to take place without your confirmation. So money can simply disappear from your account and N26 takes zero accountability. I actually considered keeping the Standard free account but after being put into yet another long wait queue to change Plans, I had enough. Steer clear.","Hey Antonia, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry to hear that this process has been frustrating for you.

Kim,"If you had asked me a month ago, was N26 a good bank i would have sung their praises but after my experience over the past few weeks i would tell anyone not to put up with the stress & frustration. I had to confirm my information but their system did not accept my spanish tax number which it had no problem with when i opened the account. After many a ""chat"" i was told to send a photo with my number on it. Lots of chats & emails later & I'm still waiting for this issue to be resolved & just a day away from having restrictions put on my one & only bank account through no fault of my own. Not a happy customer.UPDATE...on 4th August i received a message from N26 to tell me how sorry they were with the stress that has been caused & that they were doing everything to try & keep my account active! I was able to give a sigh of relief....however an hour later i received another message to say my account has now been restricted, unbelievable! How can it be so difficult & take so much time to check a number that is already attached to my account. There was no problem when i opened my account...sick of being fobbed off.","Hey Kim, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We apologise for any issues with the verification.

Julien Murzi,"53 euros were stolen online from my N26 account after I paid online the fee for an academic conference. It was clearly someone from China. N26 asked for a police report, which I provided. They immediately refunded 20 euros. But they refused to refund the remaining 33. âBecause itâs impossible that anyone could have hacked the accountâ. So it must be my responsibility. When clearly the account WAS hacked and I did nothing wrong. (And why was some of the money refunded anyway, then?)N26âs responses were corporate-like and extremely unhelpful.

Last week I chatted with support and they told me about address issue they face now and asked to contact next week. Alright, here we goâ¦ next week came but the issue is still thereâ¦ I contacted support again and they told me that the issue is still there, contact us next week. OK, this is really annoying!!!

Vincent,"Please read through my message and stay away from N26 Bank.I transferred 12K EUR to my N26 account from my Wise account, a partner of N26.Later, I attempted to send the 12K EUR to my Coinbase account. The account displayed that the transaction had been completed. However, one day later, I received an email informing me that the transaction had been blocked and that additional information about my financial activity was required.They demanded a range of information, which I have listed below. Particularly take note of questions 2, 3, and 4. I have no illicit activities to hide, but I find these questions extremely invasive.Asking for a source of funds would have been acceptable, as I understand the need to comply with bank regulations.What I don't comprehend is why you believe my knowledge of crypto has anything to do with you. I don't need your protection. I certainly don't need your advice.And what initial investment are you referring to? I have made no investments with you. My investments with other financial institutions are none of your business.The bank travel rule only applies to incoming and outgoing transactions, both of which are from and to my personal account.It has been almost one week, and I still don't have access to my funds. I have responded to your questions and informed you that if you are unable to process the transaction, you should return the funds so I can use another bank.To date, I have received no response. The money is stuck in limbo. There's been no reply, no information - just silence.If the fund is not there when I need it, what do I need it for?Marks my words.

Please inform us if you have any specific knowledge or experience in crypto trading/ microinvestments/ trading of virtual assets/ mining/etc.3.)

Philipp,"I had an account with N26 for the last 3 years and everything was going well. I transacted a respectable six figure amount with them over this period.However things went sour after a chargeback dispute of 40â¬ was handled very bad by the customer support. They send out standard messages, asking for the same information over and over again. They even go so far, as asking for information which can not be obtained. I have never experienced such an unexperienced customer support before. They preferrer to let a long term customer proceed with an account closure over a 40â¬ chargeback dispute. I mean no other bank would just let a valuable customer walk off like that. With this experience in mind I have now totally reversed my opinion on N26 and will advice my peers not to consider any investments into the startup. Yes, friends of VC's also use their products. This experience just highlights the importance of having a proper system in place where such events will never happen.","Hey Philipp, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Gyan Prakash Sahoo,Extremely poor and third class app service. Did my video verification call thrice and wasted 20 minutes.

I mean is the app development team even doing its job properly.Finally got so frustrated that had to move ahead to other service.

Yusuf,"I was mostly happy with their service till today. But today, my transfer is doubled due to a bug in their system. I initiated a transfer as usual and as the last step, confirmation with the pin was asked by the system. When I entered my pin, the system gave me an error message to enter the pin again which I did again. I think this caused the bug in the backend. After the second time, the confirmation was successful but to my shock, there were two transfers with the same amount, to the same recipient, and the same reference message. Luckily, I was able to detect the error immediately and get in touch with the support. But to my second shock, the support did not do ANYTHING apart from them saying that they have forwarded the issue to the respective department and I should wait a couple of days for an answer as if this is not a time sensitive issue.Terrible service!","Hey Yusuf, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

Sebastian Morch,"I had attempted to open an account with N26 in the Netherlands as I am a Dutch citizen and that is where I currently reside. After 2 failed attempts to register with a valid Dutch Passport and BSN number through the ID verification, I was told that due to their current verification procedures, they weren't able to offer me an account. This is after reading that applications with a Dutch passport are compatible with their verification procedure. To add context, I currently have a Dutch bank account (ABN AMRO) that I opened 2 years ago, hassle-free with the same passport.After trying to ask their customer service agents what the reasoning was, I was met with a rather rude, short, and unfriendly ""We cannot help you any further sir, we are unable to open an account for you and unfortunately, I must close the chat now."" where he then immediately left the chat. I have heard good things from friends and colleagues about N26 hence my desire to open up with them but I am left speechless at the customer service and lack of empathy i received throughout this process. I am now left clueless about what to do next as it seems N26 has no interest in providing me with further context or the opportunity to apply again.

Bianca Schuster,"Worst customer service - I do not feel that my money is safe at N26 bank. I can fully echo the last review, having had several wrongful charges in the course of the recent mastercard issues where so far N26 has not been of any help and not given me the impression they ever will. Despite what they claim on their website that you can get someone to call you back via the chat in emergencies, they refuse to do so and ask you several times to type in lengthy descriptions of what happened in a tiny cumbersome chat window, only to never receive ANY response to the additional information you provided. In addition to asking for support via chat, I initiated chargebacks via the individual transactions, as described on their website - again as it currently seems to no avail. Iâve had several cases of fraudulent charges with UK bank accounts where I received the money back - after a short call and few questions asked - within days. With N26, especially after reading all the bad reviews here, I really worry I will never get my money back.

Ayman Bouiba,"Absolutely horrible experience, I have had n26 for a few years now, I never made anything suspicious with the account, always had ongoing transactions, always a small amount to cover the fees (my plan was n26 smart).In the end on may this year, they decided to block my account with 400â¬ on it, they asked me for proof of income and an IBAN to transfer the funds, as a student I sent them an invoice for the last transaction which was a service for web dev that I do as a student. They stopped answering to my emails right after they said that they've transmitted the documents to the appropriate department, every time I re start the conversation, no one answers, meanwhile I know that they do not have the right to take my funds legally, as this was my earned money from services and not any creepy stuff. I've already talked about this to my father which is a lawyer and is telling me to wait for an answer, I really don't want to go to court for a few hundred euros but if that'll be needed, then we shall go.At this moment, my account is still blocked. This is a shame for n26, I have multiple family and friends members that have n26, I talked to them about this and I'm sure they'll close their accounts too.

Eva,"I have been a client of N26 for 4 years and used their debit card regularly. I liked how digital the bank was until last month, when I woke up in the middle of the night to see that someone has somehow been making unauthorised payments and has used up my day limit of 1000 EUR. I was very surprised as my phone or card were never shared with anyone, nor where my passwords. I locked my card immediately, flagged the unauthorised transactions and tried to contact customer support.I realised the bank doesnât offer 24/7 support unless you are a VIP member, so I had to wait until the morning, when I could also not speak to a rep, but had to chat with someone, who reassured me that the money is still with the merchant Mastercard and N26 will try to recover it asap, while they start an investigation.Three weeks later I had still not heard back from the âinvestigationâ, so I prompted N26. I was told that it is a digital wallet case, so they require a police report. I submitted one from the local police department. Just as an aside - I had let N26 know that I had my second baby later the same day when the fraud took place, and this is all very difficult for me to find time for police proceedings etc, but again, they didnât show any care or consideration.Eventually, a month after I reported the issue, I received a message from N26 where my decision to add the debit card to my digital wallet was called ânegligentâ and my case was closed with no money returned. I still had no information on how exactly the money was stolen.Also to note - N26 have posted an article themselves about how convenient using digital wallet is for transactions and encouraging their customers to use it. At no point do they mention that there will be no liability for money stolen via this channel. In summary, I am a very disappointed customer and I very much regret entrusting any money in a N26 account. I assumed that as a regulated entity, they will maintain my money safe and provide adequate customer support, but I regret to say they havenât done either for me.","Hey Eva,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.We are sorry to hear you are having an issue with a dispute.

However, the most horrible experience was I wanted to test out their smart account although my free account already had split space and some more features thanks to be old user. I talked with their customer support and they assured me that if I switch back to my old account during trial this means I still keep my rights and T&Cs I had before smart account. After that, i tested in during trial period and decided not to continue. I talked again with customer support, they told me that they will switch my account back to standard with ALL the T&Cs I had before. However, next day when I opened the app my account lost all the features even I had when I was standard user.

AR,"I have this bank for 3 years now and was happy. However last month there were 4 unauthorized transactions in a raw, someone from nonexistent tabaco accounts just taking money from my account. Luckily I saw it immediately and blocked and reported. After explaining everything to N26 plus filing a police report the same day, they asked if I received a code or sms. I said no!!! 4 separate transaction no code, link, sms - nothing!After waiting for weeks more they wrote me that I âshould have received an sms or a code therefore their decision is to not refund me moneyâ!!!Unbelievable! So the fact that your system is not safe and doesnât work - I have not received a code or sms, nor approved 4 separate transactions to different accounts - is now my fault!!!Shame on you for stealing money from ppl like that and not taking the fault when itâs clearly your fault and blame!Do not use this bank!","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

L Watson,"Absolutely disgusted with N26 at the moment. I reported a fraudulent transaction in April and requested a chargeback and they still haven't even passed the case onto Mastercard yet. I wasn't even asked to provide evidence for three weeks, and after almost another month, I was asked today to provide the evidence again. The evidence was in the message directly above the one they sent me, so I presume there isn't actually a human reading the messages.The support chat is becoming increasingly snippy with me, at first being very sympathetic and now just telling me to ""have patience"" and there's nothing they can do. More like, there's nothing they will do to speed it up. I'm sure they're understaffing and underpaying whatever department sorts these things out (I believe they don't actually have a fraud team for these cases, in which case I would never have banked with them in the first place).I also had to pay 10 euros out of my own pocket to replace the card, even though the card details were now in the hands of a fraudulent outfit.Some years ago they also charged for being overdrawn, even though I never dropped below 10 euros in my account at any time. I contacted customer service about it several times and they never did anything. They just kept parroting that they charge people if they were overdrawn, but were never able to explain when I had actually gone overdrawn, because I hadn't! It was an extremely small charge so I let it go, but now I wish I'd moved my bank account back then and used a real bank.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Milan,"N26 is regulated by BaFin, the German Banking Regulator.1. It clearly states that any applicant may not be discriminated from Opening an account.2. It also clearly states very clearly the circumstances when an account can be immediately closed by N26. However,A. N26 T&C's contradict this.B. Do not provide any reason for closure but respond with a generic msg that says N26 is following BaFin guidelines, so basically lying. To find out how unscrupulous N26 is in Germany, understand the information from the German Banking Regulator BaFin about ""Can the bank terminate a basic payment account?"" .So, my account was closed. No real info from generic or specialist support. My account was healthy and with positive balance. I dont have any loans or any defaults.Now, If N26 closed my account because of security issues, dont you think I am worried that personal data may be stolen and I need to take action to protect that. So, on that basis for N26 to not even provide me any info on why it was closed it just poor engagement.

Paola Nicolas,"I joined in 2021 and will probably be leaving in the next few days, here is why:I got a couple hundred Euros stolen from my account, I instantly blocked my card and made the report to the bank and after 5 weeks of going back and forward, sending endless screenshots and a police report, they simply got tired of me I guess, and closed my case without getting me my money back saying ""well, someone did this payment with apple or google pay, maybe it was you, maybe it wasn't but we can't and won't help you get your money back"" (paraphrase).It was through an SMS link fraud, I have no clue how they got access to my phone information since I have never shared my username or passwords, which makes me think there might be a data leak. I strongly recommed you to simple don't open an account with this bank, because if you get unlucky like me, you will lose money. It's alarmaing how easy it was for the thieves to access my account, I still have no clue how they managed to do that since there's many steps to be able to access the account and set up apple/google pay (I use none of them and there is no history of that in any of my apple/google acounts). In addition, you only get real costumer service if you pay the monthly fee, if you have a free account you will never be able to talk to real person, just the support chat.Right now the only reason I'm staying is because this is the bank account I use for my Etsy Shop (which means a good part of my earnings were stolen), and need to find a new bank for that.UPDATE: I was finally able to talk to someone and he is helping me with to open my case again.","Hey Paola, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

N26 ensured me I would get a new one shipped wherever I am in about 2 weeks for 30â¬. It's been over 2 month and I'm still waiting!! I had to reorder it 3 times already because N26 won't dare sending it. The first time they didn't even share a tracking number, after 2 weeks of asking them for a way to track my order they finally offered to send it again (wich means they never sent it on the first place). After that they did create a tracking number with DHL so that I have something to hold on but they never gave DHL anything (DHL is still waiting for the package from their part) and so after 2 weeks when the card is supposed to finally get to me it still shows like it never left Germany yet ð¡ð¡ð¡ I eventually ordered it a third time and the same story is going on again, it's been 2 weeks, DHL tells me they never received anything and well neither did I.

I decided to reorder the card and continued using it because the customer service was smooth and friendly. However, this morning, I faced another incident.

However, as a result of the fraudulent activities, my account now has a negative balance. The scammer managed to spend more money than I had available in my account because of their new service called 'Overdraft'.

They keep asking the same questions all the time and I've already sent a few documents for them to genuinely look into the delay and resolve the anomaly.I have bills to pay, so I'm very upset.I'm mystified, up until last week (when the transfer was made), N26 has been a great, positive attitude, efficient bank.  In exchange, this situation is a living nightmare, I have bills to pay.I'm not sure I would recommend N26. When you have a real/serious problem, they seem unable to keep track of the customer's information flow (that the customer has provided relating to the case/issue) and just keep telling you 'It's the other bank's problem.' even when the other bank have provided all the details they possibly can to show that the problem is at N26's end of a transaction.  Not normal.UPDATE: It has taken 7 days of contacting N26 support and asking a lot of questions to finally discover that transfers into an account need to be in Euros (mine was in GBP), otherwise N26 will reject the incoming transfer.That is really important information and should feature prominently in the 'help' section about SEPA and SWIFT transfers and how long they can take or why they can be rejected.  That's my suggestion, N26: make that Euro-only rule explicit and highly visible to your customers in your 'help' section.It's not obvious/intuitive.  Neither myself nor the sender expected such a rule about the currency having to be in â¬uros.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. All N26 accounts are euro accounts.

SEOKHEE HONG,"Awful experience with the chargeback team. Customers must be aware what you are trading in for your convenience!Recently, I tried to pay some of my bills online and this later was found to be a fraud. Now here comes the painful parts,1) Their fraud hotline only works btw 09:00 - 18:00 (Mon-Fri) - do you get it - a ""HOT LINE""? Even if you get one of them on the phone, they just repeatedly say ""did you open up a case? Then, wait for the chargeback team to contact youâ. I do not understand a point of having a HOT LINE team in this case. If they have nothing to process urgently, why they would keep the team of which name sounds like an urgent support team?2) Sure, you can open a dispute anytime, so you can move on to the chargeback process. However in my case, I was repeatedly received from the team âRest assuredâ, âBe patientâ, and about 2 weeks later, they said âSo, what happened?â as if they had just started to investigate my case regardless of all the previous conversations that I had with some of their colleagues. This feels like they are ignoring you on purpose. 3) One of my chargeback case was approved with 500 EUR previously - which was good. However, about a week later from âSo, What Happened?â, the remaining 11 cases with 2000 EUR were rejected suddenly. I do not understand the logic because, all those transactions were made on the same merchant over an hour on the same day. I was approved for one then why today the remaining cases were rejected? This clearly seems to me a miscommunication within their team,4) The reason for the rejection according to N26 is that âI willingly provided my card details to the criminal to steal my moneyâ. It makes no sense that I let others to use my money and ask for the reverse now. It is called a fraud, my team! I was paying my bills, then you are expected to put your card details of course to perform transactions. Otherwise, how can you make transactions? Banks and card companies are expected to secure those transactions and that is their business model, no? EU commission chargeback guidelines and even in N26âs own ebanking policy dictates that damage incurred from the fraudulent misuse is to be recovered. Why are they âWILLINGLYâ trying to avoid their obligations and working against their loyal customers?My fellow customers please be aware that what you are trading in for! The convenience what you are handing over for your security and support that you are expected to receive when these kind of things happen. Unfortunately, this case has been escalated to BaFin's intervention because N26 is tyring to get away with an easy way through, but I am not letting it go! So please guys, learn from me. When you are giving up for something, there is always a huge price to pay later on â the devil is in the details. You need to know what you are signing up for.","Hi there, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We're sorry to hear of your disappointment with your chargeback request. If you wish to register a formal complaint regarding this outcome, please email complaints@n26.com from your registered email address detailing your claim.

Since then they have blocked my funds of almost 7,000 Euros and will not transfer the balance to my other bank even though they have all the details.

Samantha,"Iâve had my N26 account for 2 years now and everything was going alright until last year. In November last year, my account was completely wiped out by fraudsters (almost 2000 euros). My first reaction was why didnât N26 notice the unusual activity and block my card automatically? I have had the same experience with another credit card but they immediately blocked it after 2 unauthorised transactions, but with N26, they made 20+ transactions and no notifications or alerts showed up. I later went through 4 weeks of hell trying to get all my money back. And recently, my card has been used for yet another transaction that I hadnât authorised. And again it is not flagged by N26. I have now gotten my money back and will be closing my account because my bank details have now been stolen twice within the past few months. When I received the card, I also noticed that it says âN26 cardâ on the letter (so everyone who sees it will know itâs a credit card), and it was very easy to open and close the envelope without it looking suspicious/opened. I think N26 could definitely improve on their security. It is a shame because I enjoyed using it before all of this happened.","Hey Samantha, Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.

I provided further proof that these transactions were infact unauthorized and their reply (summarized) was as follows: ""we understand your frustation but this is our final decision, please solve the issue with the merchant or the police"".

Peter,"Open a bank account with them if you don't mind that they will not help you if problems arise. For no reason, they might block your account, giving you no reasoning other than just wait. Wait for what exactly??? Expect that you will not able to talk to anyone what ever problems you have. You can communicate them only via a chat that will tell you to wait and then wait and then wait more.... Even contacting the two-cofounders, Mr. Stalf and Mr. Tayenthal does not help unblocking my account which I guess is blocked because I used another sim card in my phone for two days. I have to update on this... Of course I've sent many emails to the customer service but got no response. First, I got an email saying 'Weâve reviewed the information you provided and we must inform you that according to our current verification procedures, weâre unable to offer you an N26 bank account at this time.', what a nonsense, I've already had an account with them unfortunately. Then they decided to close down my account giving me no explanation other than citing the general terms and conditions. Fine with me, but I still have no access to my funds and it seems I have to wait days again to somehow get them paid my funds out.Also, someone should explain me if they can reply here on Trustpilot the following day why it takes almost a week for them to reply not in a standardised format to very delicate issues.

My account was frozen when I tried to transfer money from London to Berlin to support my expenses (as you do when you move to a new country) till you get your first pay check. Absolutely no communications at all and I had to find out based on 3 failed transactions. Long story short:My account is frozen, the chat agents are useless they keep closing the chat, I received my first salary and itâs locked as I canât transfer funds out.I got zero communications from N26 regarding freezing my account. All the chat agents say is itâs a âroutine checkâ. Can you imagine a bank freezing you out of your account for 3 weeks with no notice and no access to funds, common this is 2023! Also my father in law sent me money and there was no trace of it, it didnât appear in my bank account but itâs taken out of his!N26 is being operated like Mafia, I donât know why they are not regulated and have proper checks in place by governmentâ¦please read all the recent reviews of similar experience from other customers.In short DO NOT TRUST YOUR MONEY with N26â please do yourself a favour and not get into personal headaches or issues with this bank.I highly recommend Commerzbank their process is easy and they seem to be more reliable!******************Update: 29th MarchAs per EUROPEAN UNION regulations you are meant to be safe keepers of customers money and communicate with them to ensure transparency of service. This regulatory point is used as an excuse for every such issue customers have, please read several reviews below.I have no intention of banking with N26, you are stealing my money.

Petros Pollakis,"I did a mistake. I opened this bank because I moved to Sweden and as a foreigner I was just looking for a Swedish bank.. Well they are not, even if they say that on their ads on Google. But that was okay, mistakes happens.. Before I realise that this bank doesn't fit my needs I had already order my physical card.The same day I realise that they don't fit my needs so I spoke with the support to refund my money that I paid to get the card and also cancel the order and delete my account.The told me about the card yes we will handle it etc. For the next week I did twice again, ask them for my money and cancel the order of the card, they said again yes. The week after the card showed app via mail  so I asked them again on the support and they said... ""Ohhh it's policy that you don't get any refund after you get the card"".Then I asked them to delete my account and all of my data from their database and they send me a guide from their website, I followed the instructions but the ""delete my account"" page goes to an error page 404. The support guy told me that I have to close the live chat in order to delete my account. So I did it and it happened again and then I didn't have the live chat to go back and ask him why the website is not working.. They just took money and time from my life. I 100% DONT recommend this bank.-----------------UPDATE: Now they replied obv only for the second thing not for the first which was their fault. But even now to request closing the account via email I SHOULD fill form which needs handwritten signature.These guys just giving me more and more homework.

Laurence Godfrey,"This bank, which I've been using for several years now, quite obviously operates a customer service which, across all areas of banking in which I've encountered it, strives to do as little as possible for customers while boasting about how much importance they attach to keeping their customers happy.In summary, it's a third class banking service. Its protestions about its high regard for its customers' experience are insincere and made in the utmost bad faith. The best that can be said of them is that they don't steal your money.BAFIN, the German banking regulator, inform me that they receive a very large number of complaints about N26. Mine are amongst them.From an earlier reply from N26:N26 stated that my complaint is due to their closing my account for lack of compliance. That is not the case at all. They have not closed my account or asked me to close it. It remains in use. They have never raised a compliance issue with me. My complaint merely concerns their poor customer service.Leur engagement en matiÃ¨re de service Ã  la clientÃ¨le est un bruit sans significationCette banque, que j'utilise depuis plusieurs annÃ©es maintenant, a manifestement un service clientÃ¨le qui, dans tous les domaines bancaires oÃ¹ je l'ai rencontrÃ©, s'efforce d'en faire le moins possible pour les clients tout en se vantant de l'importance qu'il accorde Ã  la satisfaction de ses clients.En rÃ©sumÃ©, il s'agit d'un service bancaire de troisiÃ¨me classe. Ses protestations quant Ã  l'importance qu'elle accorde Ã  l'expÃ©rience de ses clients ne sont pas sincÃ¨res et sont faites avec la plus grande mauvaise foi. Le mieux que l'on puisse dire d'eux est qu'ils ne volent pas votre argent.BAFIN, le rÃ©gulateur bancaire allemand, m'a informÃ© qu'il recevait un trÃ¨s grand nombre de plaintes concernant N26. La mienne en fait partie.D'aprÃ¨s une rÃ©ponse antÃ©rieure de N26 :N26 affirmÃ© que ma plainte est due Ã  la fermeture de mon compte pour manque de conformitÃ©. Ce n'est pas du tout le cas. Ils n'ont pas fermÃ© mon compte et ne m'ont pas demandÃ© de le fermer. Il est toujours utilisÃ©. Ils n'ont jamais soulevÃ© de problÃ¨me de conformitÃ© avec moi.

Simon Dunne,"An absolute disgrace.I've used to bank with relatively few problems, until a client who has been paying me consistently for 20 months sent a payment (with identical details to the previous details) that was never allocated to my account.Despite the sender tracing the payment and seeing the transaction land in the receivers bank, N26 refuse to acknowledge this, or make any attempt to track the payment.I got multiple canned responses asking me to ""speak to the sender"".This is despite multiple emails, calls, and tracking numbers.My assumption at this point is the business model of n26 is the allocated a certain proportion of funds into their own accounts on a monthly basis.To be left without 11,500 euro is absolutely devastating.Happy to verify with screenshots if required.Do not touch this bank.","Hey Simon, Thank you for sharing your experience.

MichaÅ J Yegi,"Fraudster with speciality of misleading customers (with the ""bank"" since 2019)Story behind this review: I decided to go with a paid plan instead of the basic one - since then they were charging me for each incoming swift transfer - that went unnoticed as I don't check the billing frequently. When I noticed that, and asked support WTH? they told me it's a mistake and my money will be returned. They were not. Additional contact with the customer support - another version - I've asked for a transcript of the chat - the agent never send it to me. Contacted support once again - another version. Apparently under the slogan lower fees there are hidden higher fees. For 2 transfers they've charged me as much as 8 months membership of this higher, paid plan with ""lower fees"". The best part - there is no information accessible about this extra fee neither on the details of the plan in the app l, nor on the webpage with details of this plan. Only: ""Lower your fees"".It's my one of many issues, but finally it'll be the last issue with this parabank as after it'll be solved I'm gonna move to a real bank. I don't know when it may be cause though, as their complaints department does not answer for 2 weeks by now. And contacting support through the android app is a nightmare.Conclusion: they gave my money back, along with email it's not their fault, but they doing that as an act of good will. Customer support asked yesterday for the fee told me that everyone pays it (even though my family members are not charged for that). Apparently for me there is no way back - I'll be always charged for incoming transfers after trying this ""better"" plan. Answering this question took your support 55 minutes!Good luck N26!

Sean R,I have been with N26 for a couple of years and now use it for low value day to day debit card transactions alongside my ânormalâ bank account where I receive my income and handle direct debits.  N26 is more reliable than Revolut but when things go wrong N26 are unresponsive and robotic.  Overall I think this bank is somewhat useful but I would not put all my eggs in this particular basket.,"Hi there, Thank you for leaving your balanced review.

Fred,"If service is bad when onboarding, I take it service won't be any better along the way. Onboarding: One of your documents e.g. proof of address isn't valid, your account application will be rejected and cancelled and you will be treated by customer service as if you were a convicted criminal. No second change.I don't need a Swiss Private bank treatment, but I most certainly don't want to be treated as if boarding a Ryanair plane.","Hey Fred, Thank you for your interest in joining us, As a licensed bank, we must know who our customers are.

Christopher Nielsen,"Like many others, I also ignored all the warnings and opened an account with N26. Big mistake. I migrated all my stuff to N26, set up all my payments, my salary slips, did my budgetting. The app is great, user interface is solid.However, since the beginning of this year I have been denied acces to my account multiple times for long periods of time. N26 just blocks everything at Random, all your regular scheduled payments fail. Your rent payments are rejected, phone bills cannot be paid. You cannot transfer to other people. You cannot get food on the table. Your whole life falls apart when the bank you rely on suddenly decides that you shouldnt be able to use your bank account.I have been in contact with N26 many times, their constumer support service is terrible. The poor people working for them has no acces to any data and have no insight into any of your cases. So all they can do is write generic stuff like ""We are sorry for your inconvenience"" ""The relevant department is working on it"" ""I can escallate this to a superior""You can choose to escallate your case, but it goes nowhere. I escallated my issues many times and they always promise that someone will reach out to me, but to date, no one has done so. Oh, and did I forget to mention? Every time you close the chat, its deleted and even support staff cannot see your previous chats or cases? So have fun explaining your problems over and ovr again to people who anyways  does not have the means to help you.I have now finally managed to migrate my account balance to another more trustworthy bank, so unlike many others here, I've atleast managed to save my money and can now again pay my bills. As final wording, the app is nice and N26 does everything to have cool and modern branding, its a very seductive bank. But beware that you might loose acces to your money for long periods of time and suddenly find yourself without ability to pay rent and bills of you choose them to handle your finances.","Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Phoebe Ball,"UPDATE 23/03 - I am in the process of leaving N26 now, after their Trustpilot reply and lack of customer focus, which once again takes no accountability for me being a customer of nearly 4 years. I will be cancelling my ""Smart Membership"". Another huge decision in this, is also that their AI software keeps incorrectly blocking customer accounts and I simply do not trust their customer service team to be able to deal with any future problems I may encounter with my account. I received the wrong  order from a fast food chain on 16th January, the restaurant refused to refund or compensate me even though I received the wrong order, selected delivery but then ended up collecting the item because delivery wasn't possible that day. I opened a chargeback request which was rejected because apparently the case was too complicated and the merchant refused to refund?I then opened a complaint which was also rejected despite me providing all the information needed, including creating a whole PDF of documentation. I was still not eligible for a refund. I've been on live chat and they say we can't refund your money even though they have before, when I've had issued with chargeback requests. The customer service is so poor and I also pay for a Smart membership, to which I've seen very little benefit. The complaint said I should reach out to the Merchant but I can't, as it took N26, 2 months to come to this conclusion regarding my complaint, so my initial complaint with the merchant is over 30 days old and most companies do not assist further when complaints are out of this time period. I already explained this to N26 multiple times, which they've just ignored. How is it acceptable for any company to take 2 months to handle a complaint?In addition, it must have cost their team so much money, time and resources to reject my complaint, over how much my transaction actually cost. It makes no sense - it has likely cost them more money in staffing and service, they make customers unhappy and loose customers in the process. I received the wrong item, I'm out of pocket, wasted so much time on providing all the documentation needed for a complaint, no one seems to care if I close my N26 account or not and as a customer of theirs, they take no accountability. I've never experienced such awful customer service and I'm looking at alternative banking options now.30.04.2023 - after a year they flagged my review disputing it was not based on a true experience, but it was then verified after I sent evidence to trustpilot. It looks like their reputation management is trying to clean up their trustpilot score after so many negative reviews. Safe to say I did cancel my paid subscription with n26 after this, changed my primary bank account and only use n26 for very small purchases and the ease of free cash withdrawals anywhere. The most ridiculous thing about the whole thing, is they cancelled my card (which I got for free when joining them in 2019) because they said they only offered a virtual card with free accounts nowâ¦. I then had to pay approx. 10â¬ to get a new physical card to access my own money. Over the years, n26 has become way more budget centric over customer centric and their Mastercard chargeback process far stricter (to a point it disadvantages the customer) than it was when I first joined in 2019. Due to this whole experience they lost me as a paying customer and I will never use their paid services or them as a primary bank again. I would have considered updating my review to a higher score if theyâd offered me something positive like a free new physical card or their response had been pro-active or customer focused but unfortunately I lost out on money, never got my money back for this chargeback and have no trust in them as a bank or handling my money. An absolute joke! Update 18/05/2024 - I get an email from Trustpilot around once a week which states N26 have replied/ updated their review. Why? 14/01/2025 - Still getting emails from Trustpilot about N26 updating their reply and N26 tried to flag my review last year to get it taken down. I find this continued attempt to get my review taken down incredibly unprofessional. Please accept I had a bad experience, I changed my primary bank after this experience and I will not be forced to take my review down.","Hi Phoebe, We're sorry to hear of your disappointment with the outcome of your chargeback request regarding a Burger King cheese and that your further complaint took longer than expected to be investigated.A chargeback is part of a dispute process where the company can also argue and show proof of the services or goods they gave, or offer a solution that may have already been given. This can mean that they'll charge your account again in the future and become a protracted dispute.Our chargeback and complaints team will investigate the payment details and the full information provided to give their outcome.

I only have one recommendation at this stage, and that would be a 2FA confimation for every transfer. At the moment, you only need to be able to get into the account, then you can transfer funds without any further security measures. I hope this feature will come in a future update.

These transfers are only possible via the paired device. It is only possible to pair one device to your account at a time. Pairing a new device would require access to the registered phone number and card details or reverification of your ID. This would help prevent fraud even if a fraudster knew your email address and password. The cryptocurrency feature is also a closed loop so it would not be possible for a fraudster to transfer money out of the account as cryptocurrency to a seperate untraceable account.

Daniele,"It looks really horrifying how the customer service people make their best to avoid questions and provide useless advice. I have been accessing the Android app for ages and suddenly after the 1st March not anymore. Not messages, errors or info are given by the app. Just loading in a loop. To me it looks an app glitch if no info is provided. Nothing modified from the previous day. So I asked all these questions in Instagram and chat, and no tech explanation was given. It truly looked like I was talking to myself. Instead of answering my queries, N26 customer agents just go on with copy and paste blurbs and invented issue to try to to guess the answer without any clue and no listening to you. It gets terribly frustrating. Dear n26, if you are not investing in prepared and competent customer care agents, little by little your loyal customers will leave you, because it is very important that users receive a precise explanation and a quick resolution to their issues. It is cheaper to retain existing customers than to get new ones. Invest in competent people for your own sake.","Hey Daniele, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.

Werner Z,"BEWARE DO NOT USEI opened a N26 Business account, send money to my account FROM my own account then found out they can not do any international transfers that i need to pay my suppliers without a WISE account.I opened a WISE and REVOLUT account and send money from my N26 back to my New REVOLUT business account except for a part that i had in my savings and they blocked me.They now will not answer the phone except by some call agent that can not transfer you, can not explain why sending money from your OWN ACCOUNT to YOUR OWN account would flag them enough to block and terminate the account!PLEASE AVOID this company at ALL cost , they can NOT do anything worthwhile as a business and might only be useful for a private person ONLY doing business inside their own country. For Business use it is USELESS and you are much better off making an account on WISE that they (ab)use for their international transfers anyways or a REVOLUT business account!UPDATE:They now even blocked the login so i can not even have access to my bank statements i LEGALLY need to file taxes etc... I think they just stole the money and ran with itUPDATE2:Still no news on why, still no access to my statements or money and now they reask my ID that i already filed when i opened the account. So either they are very crappy with logging customer data so they cant find it or they are just stalling for time hoping ppl give up and they can scam you out of your own money !UPDATE3:Money has been returned including part of the fees for the premium account so apparently they finally realized there was no legal reason to withhold the money regardless what Mr. Peter below said and it WAS an illegal seizure of my money. I still do not have access to my bank statements they HAVE to provide and i WILL be complaining to them till they tell me wth happend to my account and WHY it was seized. I will push this all the way to Bafin to find out if i have to, seizing customer money for weeks without ANY valid reason is just NOT DONE !Will keep you all updated here when i know moreUPDATE4: 15/06/2023They still refused to let me know what reason they had to cancel my account but via trustpilot they asked more info, so let us hope they will explain themselves. For now i still say DO NOT USE !!","Hey Werner, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Incoming transactions in limbo. cards blocked. Itâs a MESSð¤¯I used to love n26. so easy, so smooth, great user experience. It felt like the perfect bank. I was even considering it for my business.Till a few weeks ago I realized money stopped coming in on my account. I couldnât believe it but by trial and error I found out that my N26 account has been FROZEN. And the BEST PART? No warning. No notice, no message from customer support. nothing.Had 10 chats with support since then and guess what. They canât tell me WHY it happened and HOW long it will take. Just that someone some time soon will contact me with more infoWent online and found many stories like these and worse. Some people used it for their businessâ¦ no access to key cash flows.  business survival under threat. huge hit to their reputation. Ouch. Apparently n26 has been a go-to bank for shady practices in the past, as it was so easy to set up and transfer large amounts. and now regulators are cracking down on them. Causing them to crack down on their users in response.Oh and the last thing. the incoming tranfers that are stuck in LIMBO, meaning they werenât refunded to the senderâ¦ guess what? N26 canât help with that. The senderâs bank needs to make a official payment investigation to get the money back. So now I have to contact a bunch of friends and clients to explain them all of this and ask them to start these investigations and if they get their money back to transfer it to my new bank. a FUN week ahead ð¤¯  @n26 @N26_Support Whatâs going on with your bank?","Hi there, We're sorry to hear that it is taking longer than expected to receive correspondence regarding the status of your account.

Josema Fernandez,"Iâm extremely disappointed with this bank, unfortunately!I have been a n26 client since they started and I have always been very pleased. Super easy to make transfers, move money, and very nice application. I created an account to my dad and my sister and they loved it too.Sadly, everything went south in the last months. For all of us, with no explanation. In my case, I received an email saying that I violated one of the terms and conditions as a client, with no further details. I have searched online and many other clients are in the same situation. There is no way to get a agent on the phone, or via chat. They close the chat without giving any details. No access to the app since my account is blocked and theyâre unable to unlock it. I have s lot of my savings here since I always trusted this bank. However, it had been more than a month where no one reached out to help or give me more details about whatâs going on. Iâm just waiting for them to transfer my money to another account on my name, waiting for more than a month.My dads situation is similar. He has some money there, but no one is giving us any explanation or details on why they are closing his account.My sister, same story but even worse since they didnât even communicate theyâll close her account.Weâre not doing anything illegal. We have made a few transfers among us, as a family.

I was able to cancel my overdraft by mistake due to very misguiding instructions.I phoned many times to try and get them to deal with my situation, and frustratingly never got anywhere.This is the price you pay for not going with a proper bank: you won't be able to speak with a bank manager for specific cases.Also, when trying to write an email of complaint via their complaint address, my emails just get bounced saying it's thee wrong email address not linked to my account. after checking each mail sent, i can confirm it very much is the corrrect address. it seem the company does not want to deal with complaints.","Hey Fred, Thank you for leaving us a review.First, we are sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support.

Fernando Ovilo Gonzalez,"Terrible experience with the N26 cashback procedure. Lack of understanding and lack of willingness to understand.A few weeks ago, in Rio de Janeiro, I took a taxi, whose service was valued at R$40 (approximately â¬7.50) according to the taximeter. When I proceeded to pay (with an N26 debit card, through contactless), the payment machine showed R$40, so I paid and got out. Later on, when I finally accessed the Internet, surprisingly, the N26 app displayed a R$3240 charge for the aforementioned service (it had the same hour and date). The day after, I completed the cashback request, since it was clearly a scam.Two weeks later, N26 asked me to upload a copy of the receipt showing the actual amount agreed and evidence that I first tried to solve the incident with the owner of the service. However, the taxi (obviously) did not give me a receipt nor an attempt to solve the incident with the driver was not possible, since I could not identify him nor his license plate. So, after all that, N26 answered me that the cashback was not justified, since I ""confirmed the transaction, and therefore the amount, using the CHIP and the PIN"".As stated before, I did not accept the 580 euros-transaction. It was a 20 minute-ride and it is obvious that none would have accepted such a huge quantity for such a short lasting service. The paying machine displayed exactly R$ 40.00 as a result of the service enjoyed, but the actual amount paid was R$ 3240.00, how can that be possible? It is clearly a fraud and I am entitled to a chargeback given the illicit nature of the transaction.In other words, the driver wrote down a given quantity but the actual quantity charged was another. I was led to believe that I was paying a certain quantity of money that resulted in a different one. That is, I accepted something under certain conditions but the result differed from that. That is the exact definition of a scam and that is why the chargeback is justified. There is a R$3200 (â¬568) difference between the agreed price and the actual amount paid, so the matter is truly serious.I really hope N26 can provide me with a better solution, since the one already given is not sufficient and shows terrible customer service and a complete lack of understanding.","Hi Fernando, We're sorry to hear of your frustration with the outcome of your chargeback request. If you disagree with this outcome and feel that N26 is liable then you also have the option to file a formal complaint.

Valentina Fitzpatrick,"Unfortunately, I would like to advise all of those N26 card holder travelling to Malta. Both mine and my husband n26 have stop working since we landed in Malta 10 days ago. Both our card suddenly stop being accepted for payment in all stores. All our payment were declined, including our Hotel. With some sporadic exception for international businesses like Starbucks, or other large company, but only for the first two days, then no more accepted payments. No business in Malta accept N26! In fact, they have no idea what this business is! We spent all holidays trying to get information from N26 Customer Service with no acceptable or explicative answer. In fact, they cancelled and re issued our card, over "" Google Pay App""! I refuse to use my phone or any form of digital payment, especially if it's an imposition! This, feels like one! However, My card, since our return to Dublin, has stop working all together. N26 have cancelled My physical card, for...we don't know what reasons!They still cannot give us a straight forward answer!We had placed all our money onto N26 and we were lucky only because we had our Bank Card with us.However, as they are not able to provide you with an acceptable answer, DO NOT relay to N26 in Malta.I am now switching to Revolute, purely because I didn't like the lack of awareness and solution focused approach and mostly because N26 has let me down BIG time! Sorry! Not good at all! Valentina","Hi Valentina, We're sorry to hear of your experience using your card in Malta. As a Mastercard our bank card is supported by most merchants internationally including in Malta.It sounds that this may be an issue with either the card settings or the processing method chosen by the merchant. In general we recommend that customers check the following during travel. 1. That payments abroad are allowed in the card settings of the app. 2. That the payment process chosen by the merchant should be savings/debit and not credit/credit card. (this can be more common issue in the Americas when cards are ""swiped"" however some hotels in Europe may also prefer a credit card payment)3. If the contactless payment is declined, please insert the card into the terminal and use your pin number. This should reset the contactless feature.4. Your card payment limits can be adjusted in the app however the following maximum limits will still apply:Daily limit: â¬5,000Monthly limit: â¬20,000Whilst we cannot check your account via Trust pilot reviews. We would normally expect that customer service would order you a replacement card if the card was damaged or broken in some way. This could lead to the old card being terminated.

Pierre Du Plessis,"About 10 weeks ago my account just stopped accepting credit transfers, this after almost a year of working fine. My employer was unable to pay me and the funds were returned. Other attempts at eft transfers, sadly, produced the same results. Needless to say, this creates enormous problems. Despite reporting this on line numerous times (as there is no physical venue I could go to to try and address the issue), the eventual - and only - outcome was that I have to wait. Well, I've waited more than 8 weeks with no feedback, not even an acknowledgement that they are working on the problem. Of course, I have been compelled to open another bank account so that my financial activity can continue.Given my shameful service experience, I would NOT recommended N26, especially if you don't like dealing with ineffective remote consultants which effectively renders you powerless and exacerbates your frustration as a consumer.

I sent a copy with the ID card and I contacted the chat support a couple of times but I didnât get any solution.

Joel Rousseau Dyson,"I am a former n26 premium and I have never been treated as badly by the customer service the last two weeks. I had been asked to close my bank account so I could open a bank account in the new country I am settling down in. It's been 2 weeks and a half and I had 4 different persons from customer service. No one could tell me why the process is stuck. Some of them would close the chat to my face saying there's a verification procedure on your account or the very incompetent person telling you that it's a problem with your phone. They don't even take care of their premium members, nor they want to help them. I cannot have a resolution timeline, I cannot know what's the problem.

Gary J. Kirkpatrick,"We join the list of people whose account has been closed without notice.  N26 sends an email removing access to your funds without prior notice and with inadequate explanation.  They claim in general that it could be due to violation of its terms or as a result of legal requirements to prevent fraud.  In our case the email notice suggested that somehow we had requested the closure, which was not the case.  It provided no instructions for what to do nor how to contact the bank.  All this caused a great deal of consternation.  After finally getting an email contact to customer service, it turns out that customer services knows no details and can just do hand holding.  We do not know how long this process will take.  We do not know if taking this long is a result of the bank having insufficient or incompetent personnel or if there are some matters outside their control.  This whole mess stinks to high heaven and I will certainly not use any online bank ever again.

CrazyWorld,"My N26 account was blocked after changing my phone number and a failed verification I needed to do to gain access to my account again. Unfortunately I got an automated email that N26 cannot give me an account anymore, which was quite unexpected as I was happy client for nearly 2 years without any major issues.  However, after I did a lot of research and reaching out to their customer chat (which is absolutely useless), social media which was not helpful, I sent multiple emails to their team which handles complaints and after many emails back and forth and announcing that I will reach out to N26 investors, the media and make my case public on social media with a set deadline, they finally resolved my case after 6 weeks of horror. It was an extremely stressful time for me because all my money I had left was in this N26 account, a mistake which must be avoided at all costs in the future. Don't trust your bank, especially online banks without physical branches and always spread your funds between multiple accounts. At the end of the day, I am happy that my case was resolved and I was surprised that they send me my money within 24hours after they confirmed by email that my money is accepted to be transferred. I generally never write reviews but I want to let you guys know, that there is hope in this nightmare situation and eventually somebody is working on your case and refund your hard earned money to an alternative bank account in your name. Just be resilient and stubborn and also set them a deadline that you will make your case public. Hiring a lawyer is not recommended as they want to take a cut of up to 30% of your locked balance and take full advantage of your bad situation, which is absolutely insane and even illegal in my opinion. Also they won't give you a garuantee!Would I recommend N26 to new customers or people that have larger amounts of money there? No!Don't put more than 500EUR if you still think this bank is a great choice. You could be next and be prepared to spend 50-100hours of your time to resolve the problem.  Good luck!","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We apologise for any frustration caused. We understand that having an account on hold is a difficult situation.

D. Alan Britton,"The Black Business Card is NOT worth its annual fee -- simply because N26 cannot back up the benefits they offer.  I had the Black Business card for 1 year here in Germany.  I was entitled to use the flight insurance policy due to a nearly 6 hour delay this summer.  I sent everything N26's insurance partner requested.  The only response I ever received was that they received it and were experiencing high volume.  I tried to contact them on five different occasions with no response and N26 saying they couldn't do anything to support because they had no control over their vendor.  I never received the app. â¬100 euros I was entitled to receive and wasted about 6 hours of my life looking into into the matter.  I cancelled the card and went back to their free account.  There's no point to have the Black account if the benefits aren't really there.@Ben from N26 If you read my review, it's not that it didn't meet expectations. It's that no one has responded to my claim submission -- in 6 months. Your apology below is as helpful as the insurance your company offers.

Andy,"Extremely bad experience with even attempting to open a N26 account.I am British Citizen who now has lived in Spain for just over 2.5 years, HSBC bank account in the UK and with UK assets (House)I  decided that I wanted to transfer from my Abanca account here in Spain to N26.Their app states 2 business days to verify your details. Still verifying after 5 business days!I contacted support to be told to wait another week or so.- I gave them another after 2 weeks (10 business days), as the app was still at the account verification stage.- Contacted their less than useful customer support where they told me that I would receive an email in the next day or so.NO EMAIL, so out of interest, went back into the application to find that I had YET AGAIN enter in verification data (Passport, as they usefully do not allow verification with a TIE card)I completed the verification steps yet again, only to be met with an email 2 business days later that I had failed the verification process.. NO REASON GIVE.I have to question if this so called bank even attempted to contact Abanca or HSBC to verify my identity with then or even follow the AML5 directives or KYC (Know your Customer)Having worked in the banking industry for 20 years I can quite honestly say that I never been treated with such contempt by a bank.N26, do you just not want us British who have escaped BREXIT to LEGALLY live in Europe to join your bank, or do you just not like the fact that I only wanted to open up one of your free account so thus depriving you of an golden cash cow income stream.Again, even attempting to press them on why I failed their verification process extracted an obviously stock response and no reasonIn summary... After hearing some of the horror stories from other people and my own personal experience:If I could give 0 stars on the Trustpilot rating, I would.DO NOT EVEN BOTHER ATTEPMTING TO USE THIS BANK.If I had treated customers at HSBC in the same manner that they apparently do (Shoddy, disrespectful and slow), I would have been out of a job very quickly!Oh, BTW N26, kindly reframe from your stock reply to this review.- No one believes a word of what you say!I will look elsewhere for a new Spanish bank accountAs for your reply... I don't believe a word that you say..Especially as a Spanish commission free internet bank has happily accepted my TIE (as an Expat in Spain) and are now processing my details...!!!Again people..Don't use this bank and if you do, consider moving away from it.","Hi Andy,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Adriano,"The account set up was pretty quick and easy. The agent was a bit rude though.Not many issues in about a year of being a customer UNTIL there is an issue... and thaat's where they fall short.The support is really not great. I requested a physical card which, after a month, has not arrived yet. They refused to send me another one with express courier at their expense although they provided me a disservice. They did not take responsibility and blamed the German postal service.According to them, I have to reorder and wait another (in theory) 15 working days to get my card.So basically, if all goes well, it will have taken nearly 2 months for a card to be delivered to me, but with the Christmas holidays, it will likely take even longer.I don't even want to know what would happen if someone had a real issue...Now I am considering my banking options.

RPS,"I contacted support to request details about acquiring a Spanish IBAN for use with the Spanish Authorities, so I could register as a freelancer.

However, I discovered while examining the N26 Spanish site that the account CANNOT be used with the Spanish Authorities to register for the as a freelancer, which was the only point of cancelling. The information given to me by support was wrong, quite useless and has simply caused issues. An agent should have simply said ""N26 can't be used for that"" or done more research rather than giving me crap advice to finish the chat.

My issue is not the closing of my account, as I know that the bank is regulated and is acting for compliance issues.  My issue is that customer support doesn't give information, it just says they will be in touch shortly.  It is not acceptable for the bank to be withholding 50,000 euros from me, and not giving me a deadline to resolve the problem.

Alison,"It seems N26 has been on a rampage of cancelling accounts lately. They cancelled my 'You' account last week, which I had for over 6 years, without any warning. I immediately sent them all the requested documents to prove that all the money passing through my account was legitimate (which I had actually already sent to them before the account was cancelled). I have heard nothing from their cancellation team since. After cancelling an account they also block your ability to call customer service, so email is the only option. I emailed their complaints department, and only after bothering them on every social media platform I received a response saying they would update me on my case on the 28th of October. The day has arrived and I have heard nothing. I needed the money in that account to pay for the flat I am due to move into next week, and could potentially lose my home if they do not return my money ASAP. I have informed them of this but have received no reassurance or assistance. Additionally, I was in the United States for work when the account was cancelled and was left without a functioning bank card or travel insurance. I also have no access to my statements to keep track of travel expenses and file my freelance taxes properly. I would encourage anyone else reading this who is experiencing the same issue to complain immediately to the Bundesanstalt fÃ¼rFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht.This treatment of customers, if legal, should certainly not be legal. I have read the N26 Terms & Conditions regarding account cancellation and have a hard time imagining how this situation abides by them, since cancellation without warning should only be granted âafter having given consideration to the legitimate concerns of the Customerâ. My very legitimate concerns have certainly not been granted any consideration at all in this matter. I have lost a huge amount of money and potentially the roof over my head. I am lucky enough to have friends who will ensure I am not cast into the streets, but other N26 customers may not be so fortunate. What really bothers me is that they seem to do this a lot, with no concern for the lives they are potentially throwing into chaos. Banks really only have one job for most people, and that's to keep our money safe. N26 have no business in calling themselves a bank.Edit: It's pretty rich that in their response below they think it should somehow be reassuring that they stole my money ""for a valid reason"". The complaints department has since informed me, via multiple emails that do not even pass the Turing Test, that they do not intend to pay back the life-destroying amount of money that was in my account. I have no choice but to escalate this externally.","Hey Alison, Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We understand that having an account on hold is a difficult situation.

Antonio,"never again in life!  I opened an account with them in Germany to channel the salary.  Simple to open, easy to use appâ¦ the first three months without any problems.  They offer me an upgrade to the next level free trial account for two months and send me a free card.  Three months after opening, I received a message that the account had been blocked for routine checks, a practice never seen before.  I can no longer withdraw from atm or make transfers.  I call for some time asking for explanations. The only thing they repeat to me is that they are normal checks that take up to a couple of days.  Three months have passed, I sent a request to close the account and recover the balance ... no answer ... the call center operators do not know what to do because it is not their responsibility.  I have asked for the contact of a supervisor and I have still been waiting for three months.

Scott Renneberg,"I shut my account after N26 chose to garnish my account instead of telling me about an outstanding bill from the city of Leipzig. It was such an easy thing to notify me of and purely because I moved from Frankfurt to Berlin in 2021, but own a property in Leipzig. It was a small land tax bill and the BÃ¼rgeramt in Berlin hadn't updated my details yet in the federal system, so the bill didn't make it to me on time. It was such an easy thing to notify me of, but instead they garnished my account and shut down my credit, which felt more like being treated like a criminal than a customer of six years. I was so disappointed in the matter that I shut my account. Then, I receive an email from a collections agency telling me I owe the bank money for outstanding fees, although nothing was ever sent to me, and my account was at 0 when I closed it (a condition of closure). I just don't understand what happened to this bank. And when I tried to clarify the matter the customer service just continually asks for further identification - even though they are the ones who put a collections agency onto me without prior notice. In the end, the bank dropped the case and realised their mistake, but it is clearly a sign of some systematic issues within the bank's customer service department. I was a customer for six years. I did everything with them - but being treated like a criminal, even AFTER shutting my account - is just next level. Avoid.Post edit: Peterâs response below perfectly characterises the lack of understanding / the lack of help.","Hey Scott, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. As a regulated we have to follow certain processes. We have a few different ways to assist you with a garnishment. This can include settling the claim for you.

Ravi S.,"N26 uses the services of WebID to verify the account holder's identity. The staff with this external service provider is extremely impolite and incapable at the same time. The lady attending to me was simply incapable of showing me exactly what she needed me to do with my ID card in order to detect the security icons incorporate in my ID card. After having to ask her to repeat what she meant yet again, she mentioned that she had already demonstrated the requested action three times and if I weren't to comply with here requests, she would terminate the call. This type of condescending behaviour is unacceptable to me. If the person requesting information is simply not in a position to convey in a comprehensible manner what is required, she should not be attending to customers - as simple as that. I have worked with various ID verification service providers and never come across such shameless and ignorant staff. Perhaps the fact that it was late at night (around 11 PM CEST), may be a reason for this person being easily annoyed, yet this is not my concern. As a customer bringing business to N26 I demand to be attended to with a minimum amount of respect and dignity.This person clearly lacked the aforementioned and moreover refused to pass me on to another operator upon confronting here with her unprofessional attitude.Although I successfully completed the verification process, I decided to close my freshly opened account with N26 as I do not wish to be associated with a bank that evidently contracts unskilled and disrespectful service providers. I am aware, my experience with this service provider cannot necessarily be associated with N26 as such, however, this highly unpleasant experience right at the start of an intended business relationship added a rather bitter taste to it and made me withdraw from any relationship with N26 at this point and in future. The fact N26 does not communicate transparently that AMEX cards, regardless of associated through google and apple pay, certainly also added to making it easier for me to drop N26 as a suitable banking provider. All in all, N26 is not recommended at all by me. If service providers are neither respectful, not professional, what am I to expect from direct employees? Moreover, transparency with regard to transfer fees, limits and restriction as to which accounts/credit cards may be associated with the account, is something N26 lacks just as much as vivid, revolut and any other shady Neo-Bank. My advice: Keep away from N26 and other dubious so-called ""Banking Apps"".","Hey Ravi, Thank you for the feedback. We are sorry to hear you had a bad experience with our verification partner IDnow.

Anne Haack,"I changed my telephone, my number stayed the same. To connect the new phone with the app, an email link to verify should have been enough, but the email link did not work at all (it said it was not valid anymore), even though I tried the process 5 times. The customer support in the chat could not help, other than suggesting to start the verification process with passport and video call all over again. Which all in all took me more than an hour to complete. Really frustrating and overly complicated experience, for such a simple thing as changing the phone, downloading the app again and connecting the same number on a different phone with the account.

Flavia Antunes,"N26 app doesn't work well and because of a bug, they suddenly closed my account and blocked all my funds. I didn't have access even to my bank statement. They asked for a huge list of documentation, and after I proved I was me and that it was my legal money, they replied saying they wouldn't return my money. All of these led me to days and weeks of real stress and suffering. I had to spend hours pressing them on social midias, writing e-mails, connecting to other people (and there hundreds and hundreds of people in the same situation) in order to get my money back. This was real humiliating and they only returned my money because I was sharing my case on social midias, and not by moral and honesty. They didn't even ask for apology. They are abusive, their employees would keep visiting my profile while they would just block my money without a human to properly see my case. Close your account and keep your money away of them.

Daniel,"In July/August 2022, N26 decided to permanently close my account without warning, and keep all my salary and savings. What triggered it I believe was just me genuinely trying to update my phone and address details after a change of address. They offered no options whatsoever. Their Support department offers literally zero support - The best they can do is a Copy+Paste message, or referring to an old email, then immediately permanently ending the chat! Only through raising a formal complaint (Complaints@), submitting all kinds of evidence (over 20 documents) and through submitting a BaFin complaint did I get any kind of resolution. I literally went hungry and borrowed for 6 weeks before getting the cash back - and I was one of the lucky ones! They never gave any sort of satisfactory explanation as to why this all happened.

Elitsa D.,"I am very disappointed by the security measures (not) implemented by N26. This is the second time I needed support and nobody could help me. The first time it was malicious activity with my account - I contacted them immediately to tell them to stop two payments I had not done -several times via chat and phone. They still let two payments of more than 800 euros come through that I told them I had not made. I am still waiting for them to refund the money and now need to hire a lawyer to deal with this. Very disappointed. Now comes the second security issues - my mobile phone got stolen yesterday and I had the same frustrating experience - no immediate help line, only chat and they were not able to help me at all or even assure me that my account is safe in case my stolen mobile phone got hacked. It is my serious concern that they have no proper security measures, so think twice before you use N26 as your main bank account. I am quite sorry I did so but after a whole year of transitioning from my old bank I now need to restart the whole process and am very very angry about that.","Hey Elitsa, Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback.

Anonymous-Fearing-Reprisal,"N26 claims that it has been legal for it to suddenly terminate the bank accounts of hundreds of customers, confiscate their money, and compel them to struggle (for weeks or months) through a process of ""applying"" to obtain their money back from N26 -- claims that it has been legal, and necessary, as part of the panicked, incompetent anti-money-laundering efforts they are implementing, after being scolded, penalized and fined by German bank regulators for N26's failings in this regard (top executives were charged and prosecuted). However, what they do to these customers -- myself included -- is in fact not legal, because for it to be legal, they are required to do due diligence to avoid undue harm to innocent customers. Failing that due diligence, what they are doing is illegal and they are facing several lawsuits as a result. Meanwhile, I am suffering the same plight as a Ukrainian war refugee described in a recent news article about N26's scandalous behavior:  although I am in less desperate circumstances than a war refugee, I am unable to access my 10,800 euro in savings, unable to receive my salary, unable to receive my rent, needing to borrow money from friends to buy groceries, and several other financially damaging consequences to complicated to explain here. N26's process for allegedly, maybe, possibly giving my money back to me at some undisclosed future point (if at all), is not only showing zero signs of progress after many weeks, but I am given zero updates on what is going on. It is illegal. Their terrible reputation for awful customer service cannot be papered over by the newly hired staff such as ""Peter"" who has responded here to several upset reviewers with friendly, polite and caring tone. Friendly, caring words are cheap and easy but no substitute for basic competence and legality in handling customers needs and rights. My money has essentially been stolen from me. The experience of many other customers who have written about this here is a tiny, tiny fraction of what is going on. News media in Germany have begun reporting about it. The founders and leaders of N26, now filthy rich, should be thrown in prison for the suffering they have caused to my wife, my son, me, the Ukrainian refugee profiled in one news article about this scandal, and hundreds of others. I look forward to your friendly but useless reply, ""Peter, N26 Customer Support.""","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Sam Warner,As others have mentioned the banks 'support' is shockingly bad.It's hard to believe that this is a certified functional bank. They cannot provide even the most basic level of customer service.As others have mentioned their support staff just send their 'Are we still connected' line and then end the chat so they don't have to answer questions or help you. They have no training and cannot do anything. All they can literally do is regurgitate the FAQ on the website!!And it not like I've been asking difficult questions....I'm literally trying to get my bank card i ordered 5 months ago!!This is literally a bank that is incapable of sending a bank card to its banking customers.N26 is a joke and you should choose any other bank possible.,"Hi Sam, Thank you for reaching out.

Nad S.,"After my email was changed in the N26 system (since the old one could't receive any email to reset the my password) I proceeded with the ID authentication process and I've been waiting more than 1 week for my data to be authenticated. Every time I contact the chat, they say they're working to resolve this, but they don't give me a period or information about what's going on. I am unable to use my card, make withdrawals or payments and of course, no access to my account. All the money i have is in that bank, how can I just keep waiting if I urgently need to use my money for basic things like buying food and so on.","Hey, Thank you for the review.

I R,"This is the worst and most unfriendly bank in Europe.  The bank blocks accounts without explanation.  Terrible support service. After receiving data from you about the origin of your funds, in order not to return the money to you, they began to send statements to the police that the client might be engaged in money laundering. And then they can send you email that all your money was transferd to another banks. Never use this bank.  You will need expensive German lawyers to get your funds back. The bank can simply steal your money.  In Germany 4 top managers are under criminal investigation, Bafin fined the bank for 4 million euros, in Italy the banking regulator banned the n26 bank from opening accounts to new clients.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review We apologise for any issues with your account.Please reply to our Trustpilot request so we can review your case internally.

Andrei U,"Avoid this bank by any means! This bank used to be an innovative fintech gem. It's not anymore. After getting a fine from BaFin, since late 2021 they've started the slaughter and purge of their most loyal customers.Under the pretext of ""routine checks"" they detect ""suspicious activities"" and they not only suspend accounts, but delete them! Yes, exactly, they automatically delete accounts without prior notification and keep the funds. What happens next? A total nightmare. As they don't offer phone support (any attempt to chat with their bots is a sad experience) you have to write thousands of emails and wait in line for weeks or even months without even knowing if you get your money back. The list of documents they ask is completely ridiculous, and they are worse than any financial authority. They are not even able to point out which transaction is suspicious. This is not banking, this is stealing, it's illegal and no other traditional bank treats the customers like they do.Just google ""account closures n26"" and then decide if it's wise to open an account with them.","Hey Andrei, Thanks for sharing your experience with us.

Roberto Zanon,"From 2 WEEKS I can not access my money any more (I have almost all of my money earned in the last years in the N26 account).They have no reason to suspect that I was doing anything fraudulent, given that all the money in the account was coming from my employee salary payments and almost all of the money was spent legally in a traceable way though their credit card or SEPA payments towards other EU bank accounts.All their customer support agents are giving always the same useless answers, saying that it is a normal routine check that any EU bank is supposed to do.But I had different bank accounts in Germany, Italy and Nederland and none of them ever locked my account for even just a day.If you have any relevant amount of money, KEEP IT SAFE IN A REAL BANK, not in N26.","Hey Roberto, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Sotirios Efstathiou,"Basically stole my money, since they froze my assets without warning or reasoning. This happened 2 months ago and the support of N26 since then was absolutely horrific. I have not seen my money ever since. The Customer ""Support"" in its answer implies potential fraudulent activity but fails to specify or show any line of evidence for this claim. If N26 finds any of these fraudulent activities within my bank account, specify them and be done with it. Not answering and actively ignoring customers for months, while freezing their assets is borderline criminal.Update: Only after threatening N26 with a lawsuit, they were kind enough to unfreeze my assets. No information about the reasons of the freezing of my money were given at any point. No apology. No compensation for opportunity costs, only a miserable customer support.","Hey Sotirios, Thank you for taking the time to write a review. There are many reasons why an account may be blocked.

Laura,"Be very careful with this bank. I worked with them for over 2 years without any issue, but then recently had a big issue. Essentially I was frauded over 2.4k euros. The fraudster was able to set-up a digital wallet even though I completed no connection nor received any push notifications/SMS from N26. N26 is saying this was negligence on my part, but I NEVER completed any digital wallet connection. They clearly do not have strong enough security in place if someone was able to confirm the connection without my knowledge. They are now refusing to return the money. From looking online others have also had this issue. Before this experience they were great, but this has completely ruined my trust with the bank.

Smeets,"the bank doesn't understand what urgency is . many conversations but little or no help. a document that the bank needs to confirm takes weeks in a normal bank 30 Minutes.the bank promised fast and speedy reactions but that is false. we have written to the CEO Mr. Stahl : no reply. When N 26 reviews the complaints they never provyou with a real answer. The same answer : we serve in several languages...but mever a solution.

We have alerted the basin and the European authorities. They write standard replies , confuse their own answers and as a cause my pensioen didnât get paid. Rather than helping they ignore !

Drocca Lagel,"... about time for an honest and less vague review. I plunged into despair after losing both my phone and debit cards in Spain ... luckily I was able to obtain a new phone before i lost my debit cards ... the issue got more complex because my cards were blocked by customer service at N26 upon losing my cards ... and I had trouble getting a new SIM card activated by a SIM card provider. Of course, a blocked debit card means you can't buy any new SIM card or a new phone, so be warned ... a new card could take a few days to arrive ... I managed to find my lost debit card the following day I lost it ... but it was temporarily blocked ... I finally got my replacement SIM for the new phone and I was able to then pair the device with the help of customer service. It was a very stressful experience, and my health is not great, but the support of N26 (although hard to articulate at times), helped me regain access to my account. I then needed to change my email address back to the original, this did cause me to lose access to my account, but eventually, it was resolved.

Rohana Reading,"I recently opened an account with N26. it was a smooth process, the app is good and for a while everything worked perfectly. However my card was blocked (I have no idea why) which means I have no way of accessing my money (I can't use the bank transfer function either). the live chat was useless; they said they couldn't help and I would receive an email. Email never came so I tried live chat again with the same response. the live chat cuts off immediately after saying that they can't help and I must wait for an email. I then wrote to customer support and the following day received an email back saying it was to do with routine compliance checks and there was nothing they could do about it. I have now made a complaint but as soon as I can get access to my money again I will be moving it out and closing the account. It's a shame as I thought it was going to be really good but I can't risk this happening again at a time when I might really need to be able to spend my money urgently.UPDATE: It is now 5 days since I have been able to access the money I have in this account and I have had no meaningful communication from N26 - just automated emails thanking me for bringing the matter to their attention!

The reaction n26 posted here are the standard text blocks that have no extra info to the FAQ and contain only reasons I could already rule out.

However, transfers may sometimes be delayed if they need to be checked due to SEPA banking regulations.Regular incoming SEPA transfers should arrive within a maximum of 2 working days. Kindly note that if a transfer is made just before a weekend or holiday, the time frame will be extended to a maximum of 3 working days. Incoming SWIFT transfers can take up to 4 working days to arrive. Following European banking processes, N26 has the responsibility to run routine checks on transactions. As a result, we may ask for documentation to verify the origin or source of these transactions. This can result in the credit being delayed or not taking place.You can find more information about why transactions may fail or be delayed on our Support Centre here: https://support.n26.com/en-fr/payments-transfers-and-withdrawals/transfers/why-did-my-sepa-transfer-failBest Regards,Rose, Your N26 Support Team.",2022-06-29,2022-06-29,2.0,0,2022,Positive

Justin Jones,This so called bank is an absolute joke and is a scam. I tried to pair a new device 7 days ago. My ID is still being verified. Ive had the account for 2years. Iam unable to access my money. And nobody can give me a date when i can expect to. The support and chat are useless. They have basically stolen my money and i cant do anything about it. I have children to feed and bills to pay. Ive begged and begged for help. To no avail. My next option is going to the police.RE REPLY.Yes i understand your need to stick to the regulations. But my account has been open for 2 years. All i needed to do was unpair an old device and pair my new one. I completed the live one on one verification process with one of your colleagues. He mentioned no problems. Its now been 9 days without access to my money. And nobody can give me a date when i can expect to re gain access. My case has been escalated twice by N26 support.

Nina O,"After 4 years I think that I have finally decided to change banks. The customer service is miserable, and I have never managed to get actual help over these past 4 years. The last straw has been a paycheck that got lost and never arrived to my N26 account. Customer service was unhelpful to say the least, and they would refuse to open an investigation. The sender's bank back-office contacted N26 to try to see what was happening but they never received an asnwer. Now suddenly the sender's bank has received a transfer from N26, this was not a rejected payment, but a new transfer initiated by N26, which means that N26 actually received the money, contrary to what all agents have told me these last days. I lost hours for a paycheck that I have never received, I have no way of finding out what went wrong,  as the N26 customer service is completely useless, and I won't trust this bank any longer with my money. Funny that Trustpilot asks for a case number, not only do I not have a case number, N26 doesn't even save the chats from customer assistance, and if one is not fast enough in typing one is kicked out from a live chat.","Hi Nina, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. For technical and security reasons the any receiving bank of a transfer cannot trace or disclose details about a transfer. This is a standard banking process. Whilst we appreciate that you feel that customer support was not helpful in this instance, there is not a technical process that can be followed from the receiving side that they could offer. On occasion it may be required to inform you of your options with the sending bank even if this means that customer support cannot directly solve this issue for you.For example if details of a transfer were incorrect when supplied to N26 this would not be linked to your account and the only secure option would be to send the transfer back to the sending bank. It would not be a secure process to inform or deposit the funds to the most likely account as we may have customers with similar names or other details. Thank you for your feedback.

Nadir Tarchaoui,"The worst experience with this bank. I needed to wait for my money and then I find out that the money that I send was declined. They did not notify me or nothing, so I was waiting for it to arrive and they told me that there was a chance that it would arrive ASAP. My other bank told me the transaction was cancelled and that N26 should notify me about it. I broke my card and threw it in the sea. Worst experience and very bad for money transactions with other countries. If possible I would give -10 stars!

Zoltan Lukac,"As long as I was using the bank and the card just for regular deposits, withdrawals and charges all went well.    However, 4 years after starting my account at N26, one day 39 fraudulent charges were made to my credit card, all within less than 20 minutes, for over EUR 1k and all from 2 vendors who I had never made a transaction with before.  A classic case that should have been caught by any basic AI or fraud prevention process, yet didn't at N26.Even though I caught the fraud, contacted the specialist on the chat, disputed all 39 charges AND blocked my credit card within minutes of the fraud, almost a month has passed and N26 has still NOT returned all my money from the fraudulent transactions!Furthermore, over the past weeks I had to engage 7 customers service specialist to finally get the last one to act and for customer service to send me a personalized message!Yet, there will be no trace left of all this since N26 doesn't provide you with a transcript of the chats! What's worse, once you read the messages on your N26 application it is immediately deleted! (Fortunately I have kept print screens from all conversations).

Niall MacAllister,Extremely difficult to access your funds. Card payments are regularly rejected even though there are sufficient funds in the account.  Very poor communication from them.,"Hi Niall, We're sorry to hear that you had some difficulties using your card. I can offer the following general guidance but for more specific rejection causes you will need to contact customer support in the app via verified chat. If this issue is recurring for you in stores you may need to insert your card and use your pin to reset the contactless feature. If this is more common when you have your card details saved on a website it can help to remove your card details and add them again so that the full 3D secure confirmation is triggered. When travelling abroad please let the merchant know that your card is a debit card and not a credit card. This misunderstanding is more frequent in countries such as the USA, Mexico and Brazil.

V.K,"I had opened my bank account with N26 in February and had used it only once, I transfered some money from my Belgian bank into the new N26 account in order to be able to use it. Early April, I got an email saying they closed my account for "" irregularities that require them to terminate my N26 account pursuant to the Termination Clause of the Terms and Conditions of my N26 account on an extraordinary basis and without prior notice"". No explanation on what was wrong, no money back. Thankfully, I didn't have much on it but still theft. When registering I had real people at N26 check my identity but still their system found something wrong with me transfering money from MY OWN ACCOUNT to the N26 account. Instead of making a procedure to re-check my identity or something similar, of course it's easier for them to just delete my account and ransom my money. From what I read, that happened to many people before me.

Screen subsequently froze and this was 18 days ago with no access to my account since then. WebApp doesnt work as it tells me to use phone app. Card was blocked. They have cancelled my account citing a non existent paragraph in their Ts&Cs and told me to send them details of my new account so they can transfer my holdings..... that was 6 days ago and no sign of my cash! They do not respond to my daily emails and ask me to be patient during unverified chats.,"HI Mike, Thanks for reaching out.

Warren Stribling,"Hello,I'll try to keep this short and spare any actual details of all the reasons n26 has failed as a decent bank. In short, n26 is not as international and helpful as they claim to be. I have been a digital nomad / traveling English teacher for years and fell under the same advertising spell. It is false advertising. I now live in Mexico and my old card expired. I originally opened the account when I lived in France. Not only can n26 not change your address to a new country, they won't ship a new card to wherever you are (even if you are willing to pay for the shipping). That's a pain, but I had the card shipped to a friend in England. That never arrived and later I asked and they said they would never do that. So I tried again and had to pay for a 'lost card' to an address in Spain. That worked and my friend sent it to me in Mexico. I activated the card via the app and when it didn't work, they said I had to activate the card by using an atm... in France. (I have screenshots of this cold behavior for anybody wanting to see proof.)Customer service did not help in any way. In fact, in every contact with them, they were not capable of problem-solving or compassion in any of my frequent attempts at communication with them. Get the card now and enjoy it for a few years, but plan to be left out to dry when you need assistance. They are only concerned about customer acquisition, not customer retention. Sincerely,Warren","Hi Warren, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear of your disappointment with your account.

Thais,"They blocked my account without notice, blocked access to my balance, won't allow the money to be transferred. a totally unilateral, abusive and arbitrary decision. They do not answer the several e-mails that I have sent. Very bad experience. I want to distance myself from digital banks like this!_________Update (Apr 19th):The  N26's answer below besides being protocolar is false. I received a notice of my account cancellation that informed me that I had 02 months to transfer the funds from the account and that until then, it would remain active. I planned the transfer considering this time frame and my weekly withdrawal limit. (even though I was still trying to talk with N26 to clarify the episode, I never heard back from them).However, 01 month before the end of the deadline, the bank, without notice, blocked the account and the funds that were there without further explanation, contradicting the guidelines that they gave by e-mail.Any attempt to understand or solve the case by chat (since the bank did not respond to support e-mails) resulted in the closure of the conversation once I had identified myself. This behavior is illegal, arbitrary, abusive, and certainly is not supported by any current European banking legislation or regulations.UPDATE 30/04/2024After two years, they respond again in a protocol and misleading manner. To prove that I had no compliance problem, I have some e-mails and messages from N26 where they offered me 100 euros (almost nothing and totally offensive) as compensation for the inconvenience. What's more, there's no justification for withholding the money for almost two months and not having at least one contact line to give any feedback to customers who have been left in the lurch. With this feedback from you after all that time, the perception of the bank is even worse and proves that you haven't learned anything in the last 2 years.","Hey Thais, Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

Hussain.,"Worst experience ever!!1- First attempt to verify myself was with a guy, who sounded Spanish. He had the worst attitude ever, like he was forced to work. I asked him directly when I noticed his demeanor, and then I had to abort and I told him about it, to which he replied something along the line of: oh you don't speak English, which obviously was not the case. 2- Second attempt was with a sweet young lady, I told her about the incident, she carried out the verification procedure, but could not complete it and she suggested I email the support team. She gave me the address and I sent an email and I mentioned the issue with the first guy. 3- Instead of addressing the verification, or the issue with the first attempt, I received an email saying ''For security purposes this topic cannot be addressed via email, therefore I kindly ask that you contact us via chat so that we can proceed your account closure request.You can open a chat with us in the following way:... ''4- I replied back, asking if they actually read my email, because my original email does not mention anything about account closure, this was on 20/02/20225- No answer till today.

So don't waste your time with that bank.,"Hey Roman,Thanks for leaving us a review.The Mastercard exchange rates are applied when you make payments in a different currency.

Emmer,"For over a month I have been blocked access to my account for some inexplainable blanket reasons termed as ""breach of policy"". Later I got a notification by mail that they were closing the account and I should provide an alternate account where the closing balance should be sent to, and till now nothing of such has been done. No information what so ever, nothing at all, and even the notification email they sent notifying of closing the account looks like a phishing email. I saw these similar type of reviews and made a huge mistake not taking them into consideration and not closing the account myself before time. Now I have to resort to start looking for access to money. WORST service out there ever, if you like your peace of mind never you, I repeat never you try to open an account with this bank, its when you start having challenges you will realise you made a mistake and that the bank doesnt necessarily care about you.After I wrote this review, initially their customer care rushed down to write their usual lines. Meanwhile I have contacted them by email, no response, sent twitter message, and as usual, their default answer ""we will pass on the message"". This is two months now!! I will enforce my right to information in court. Crappy bank. If you have any evidence I did a crime bring it out or give me my money.","Hi Emmer, Thanks for reaching out to us. We're sorry to hear this issue has taken longer than expected to resolve. There are several reasons why N26 may block or close an account. These reasons come from our decision as a business to act in line with our risk management policies, as well as our need to comply with relevant statutory obligations.This means that N26âas a bankâneeds to act in line with laws that exist to combat illegal activities such as money laundering, financing terrorism, tax fraud, and abusive or fraudulent use of the account.

Michael Shuldman,"Ordered some tools online and paid via N26.  Tools never arrived, online shop abroad did not respond to email, and a few weeks liter, online shop's website stopped working.Thought it would be trouble free to get a charge back via N26, but they insisted I fill out a police report and send them a copy, which took me by surprise.  The cost was not all that big either (USD 53).  Tried to find out why a police report was required repeatedly, but they would not answer except in general terms, and in the end, N26 simply closed my case in response to my last question about why a police report was required for this chargeback.Before spending a few hours going back and forth to a police station in order to get a police report I thought I would use this as an opportunity to find out whether paypals's buyer protection is any good, since the shop's payment system was linked to paypal, and it was paypal who handled the charging of my N26 card.Paypal informed me they would look into it and give the shop two weeks to respond.  After two weeks, paypal refunded the money to my N26 card, while N26 refuse to do anything without me getting a time consuming police report.Conclusion: N26 only works ok as long as there is no problem.  If you pay for something you do not receive, prepare yourself for a lot more work than normal in order to initiate a chargeback process.

No futher information could be given neither a contact to reach the senior member, putting a brick wall with a smiley in front of me. In the end got the response that chargeback can last 120 days, which is the outcome if a update is provided within 8 days and that would mean N26 simply ""missed"" to write me on time.Everything else was fine, but this gave me a idea for a start-up.

We're sorry to hear that the chargeback process is taking longer than expected to resolve.The chargeback process is covered by Mastercards payment protection policies. It enables an impartial dispute process. From the scenario described it sounds like Opodo is disputing your chargeback request and may provide evidence to support their claim. In some cases this may be required to be arbitrated by Mastercard.

Darren Page,Worst bank. Let me open the account then after 2 weeks put my account on hold to do a I.D verification again after doing it twice before.

A Williams,"I was a bit cautious joining one of these digital banks without any branches, but they were able to open an account for me in Germany and it was a quick, easy process for people with UK and EU passports. They speak English. The customer service is not always that great, but I'm used to bad customer service from living in the UK anyway so I don't have high standards in that regard. As long as a bank acts competently and does the job, I'm happy.Unfortunately, I had to close the account again as the UK left the EU and N26 was not able to keep customers who were residing in the UK. Closing the account was easy. I switched to Starling Bank, which is a UK bank that also operates digitally, but I found Starling useless in comparison to N26. Starling Bank's app is full of IT flaws, but I didn't have to deal with any IT flaws in N26's app. It was a shame I had to leave N26 as the UK's Starling bank was so inferior, but Brexit forced me to close the N26 account.",Pending,2022-02-15,2022-02-15,5.0,0,2022,Positive

Rita,"I need an account in Spain with a Spanish IBAN to pay electricity bills etc. The Spanish bank especially Lacaixa is very expensive for non-Spaniards and the service quality is really annoying. According to information I got on the N26 website, it was possible to get a Spanish account without having a permanent address there. While opening the account I gave my permanent address, which is in Germany and thought I had better ask first whether I would get a Spanish IBAN or a German one. It was not possible to find this information on the website inspite of the many hours I spent doing this! So I sent a mail to support N26 and got a reply (within two days!) that if I am a resident in Germany I will get a German IBAN. Now, I donÂ´t need a German IBAN! Unfortunalately their information on the website is very misleading and unclear. A lot of my time was wasted because of this unprecise information. Better to be simple and clear: Write, instead: You can only get a Spainish account number if you have your main residence there. That would have helped me more and saved a lot of my time.","Hi Rita, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

I only read bla bla bla.How difficult is it for a German bank to verify a German National ID card of a German born German living in Germany? If this takes you beyond your capabilities then try to do business that you understand and manage. And the core of my complaint is that you did not even tell me that you are unable to open a bank account for whatever reason but just leave the application process open for weeks without any feedback. Like 'What do you need from me to help you solve this' kind of feedback. Maybe this has to do rather with the recently repeated money laundry allegations of N26 that has led authorities to impose a limit to the growth of your customer base? Just speculating.

Eva,"I have no trust in this bank anymore.Moved away all my funds and I cancelled my plans for further use of my N26 account.Because of them and their indifferent customer agents (who did not support my claim for a very clear fraud case to Mastercard) I lost a chargeback for a **significant amount** related to an event that was supported to happen on the first year of the pandemic.To note here, all other ticket holders have successfully won a chargeback, with Mastercar, as they are account holders with banks that actually supported them to do so!!In addition: their customer support tool works terribly, introducing much more difficulty with dealing w issues.Do not prefer this bank.Better go to Revolut or any other online bank than N26.",Pending,2022-01-26,2022-01-26,1.0,0,2022,Positive
Emanuel-Petre Eni,"horible customer service. I used to use as as a secondary bank as I cannot trust a bank that you cannot reach over the phone. the customer service agent don't bother to read your questions. they just send scriptic answers that match you keywords. you might ask them why there's a difference in transaction dates between your 2 month old statements and web app, and they will tell you that you that you can check your transactions on your mobile and that it takes a few dates to be marked as completed. utterly useless. they will never be taken serious unless they actually start behaving like a proper bank and respecting customersLater edit: even here when in public they still say yeah your app and export will show different dates. well, 1 month ago it was showing the same date. so you screwed something up and instead of listening to the customer, you give useless long information","Hey Emanuel,Thank you for the feedback.The dates on a transaction may vary depending on when the authorisation was settled. You can download the balance statement to see the exact dates. These can vary from the initial reserved payment you see on the app home. You can view and download your account statements in the mobile and WebApp by following the below steps:1) If you're using an iPhone, tap on the 3 bars in the top right hand side of your screen and select Balance Statements.2) If you're using an Android, your account statements will be under Statistics.

Michael,"Very poor process for ID check from a customer point of view. I bank with many 'neobanks' and this usually takes 60seconds to maybe 5 min. N26 (or their provider) took me through a laughingly complex process that a traditional bank (or borderforce) wouldn't do. Maybe that is the requirement but the support agent was extremely condescending, kept losing patience with me whilst his 'instructions were not always clear'. I could hear him and his colleagues in the background making fun of how 'stupid' customers were. Really? Makes me worried what's next.","Hi Michael,First of all we would like to apologise if your experience of opening the account was negative.

N26 told me to close my account (which I already have for a long time) and apply for an Italian one. But this would not happen straight away, I had to be put on a waiting list. Not very customer friendly. Peter, from N26 support, was kind enough to reply to this bad review with the note that IBANS are accepted by all European states. Thanks for nothing Peter: I know that.

At present we do not generate a TRN number when a transfer is made. I have passed on your feedback as this is a common request for customers in Italy.

jean-pierre damen,I have been a premium member since 2017 but today cancelled my premium-account.For technical reasons my overdraft was not working. I have called numerous times. But after two months still no answer why it wasn't working OR that a technical failure will not happen again in the future.A failing overdraft can get you in a lot of trouble with Direct Debits.

Kristina Wiens,"I am aware that the pandemic is a big challenge for all of us. However, I am not sure that this has so much to do with the quality of the chat conversations. Unfortunately, I have had rather unsatisfactory experiences with the N26 chat staff so far. As a general principle, the chat conversations were very one-sided; in the sense of ""taciturn"" and seemed insecure as far as the advisors were concerned. As a business customer of N26 with my own company, I also expect my bank to provide me with competent employees in the business customer area who shine with expertise and know how to help with practical solutions. I have now often encountered employees in the chat who seemed to me like teenagers who neither expressed themselves adequately nor used correct spelling or even bothered to do so. Or even answered in a flippant manner - although I remained polite. This is unacceptable and extremely annoying and makes one wonder to what extent these so-called ""experts"" are at all familiar with the financial area of N26 if they cannot understand or explain contexts.","Hey Kristina, Thank you for taking the time to report your experience with our service.

Robert Scott,"Last year my phone was robbed in Ukraine and I had good reason to believe the money was stolen from my account. Initially the customer service advisors in the chat function did their best to help. We tried numerous new verification procedures to regain access to my account but for some reason none of these worked. Curiously the advisors believed my identity enough to block transactions from the account but not enough to tell me whether my money was there or not. Ludicrous in the extreme.From that point on I was directed to the e-mail address where I outlined the problems I faced. Absolutely nothing back from them. E-mail after e-mail fell on deaf ears. I was still none the wiser as to the whereabouts of my money â was it there or not? Given that the incident involved me being drugged and beaten up I expected more concern from the bank. Perhaps a number to contact them would have been helpful given the seriousness of the crime.In December I finally got an e-mail saying that N26 was terminated their relationship with me as of 31st December. Iâm guessing this is because I failed the verification procedures or perhaps they think I am the fraudster trying to scam them. Who knows? Without being able to communicate with them I have no way of knowing what they are thinking.They said they would transfer any remaining funds to my UK account but it is now 7th December and nothing received. I now then have to believe that the thugs who stole my phone got into my N26 account and siphoned off the money.My next step in this nightmare is to fly to Germany and try to contact N26 directly, and also involve the German police. The bank now has a legal obligation, as far as Iâm aware, to help me get that money back. Iâve been appalled by the actions of the bank in this situation. My mental health has taken a hit as I constantly worry what has happened to the money, and why the bank wonât help me.If anyone from N26, or anyone who has been in a similar situation, is reading this please let me know what the next step is. I donât want more e-mail addresses to direct enquires to that end in a brick wall of indifference. This has gone on too long now.","Hi Robert, We're sorry to hear that you have had difficulty receiving the transfer of your remaining funds after you could not gain access to your account after a failed verification process.If you are considering taking legal action then the first step would like to make a formal complaint.

Tuells Martin,N26 application is very dangerous because a thief with your phone can see all the numbers of your card and make shopping in internet. N26 will not reimburse you for this fraud of which you are the victim.,"Hi Tuelis, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. If a thief was in possession of your phone they would also need to have the login details for your phone and the login details for your N26 app before they could view your card information.When you pair a new phone this will also unpair the old device. It is also possible to block your account via phone call if you have lost your device and do not yet have an alternative.Most online purchases also require confirmation within the N26 app. When reviewing a chargeback case we can also identify if the transaction was confirmed within the N26 app. This will also show that your confirmation pin was used.All of our card payments are covered under MasterCard consumer protection. Part of that protection involves investigation by N26 into the validity of the request. If you feel that the outcome was unfair you also have the option to file a complaint by emailing complaints@n26.com from your registered email address.

Henrik LiverÃ¸d,"N26 is unable to spell my name correctly on my bank statements. My surname contains the letter Ã¸. In my bank statements, this letter appears as oe. This is a huge problem for me as I need bank statements with my correct name for my company. Simply spelling an Ã¸ as an oe is not sufficient. What really makes me rage though, is that the customer service has promised me 4 times to do something about the problem. Guess what? Nothing ever happened. I contacted the customer service via chat 4 times and each and every time I was promised that this error would be fixed as soon as possible.

Martin Raun,"Super watch out !!! ....N26 will not let you change phone numbers. My story short; have been given a temporary company phone while transferring from Denmark to France where I was given a fixed company phone number. I opened my N26 account basis first phone number and now I have my French phone, but in the meantime in the transfer to my new residence country my employer cancelled my first one from origin country (Denmark). Now after 3 months I cannot transfer a new number to the account as I have lost my acces from the first number it was opened with. N26 will only allow Phone contracts in own name. In my case and I belive in many other cases we are having professional phones and only carry 1 phone in our lives. Since my employer is an international company they hold large general phone contracts and these are not associated with the general username like a privately held contract. Now more than 3 months later no resolution even if certificates from employer, passports and IDs, following their guidance have brought me anywhere. Simply a very unprofessional company when handling such a request. NOW I am blocked to control my own account visibility, shopping. I can only hope I run dry sooner or later on  the account in order for N26 not to keep the control with my savings. I am sorry to say things started out great, but have gone really bad. My resolution from their side; open a new phone contract with your name on it...... Frankly I am surprised about their ability to understand a regular professional life with company phones. And seriously I will not start paying separately m own phone contract only to get account access.....","Hi Martin, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. It sounds from your description that you wanted to register a phone number to your account that is already in use on another N26 account or sign up record. This may be likely if the company you work for has given this number to another member of staff in the past.

MH,"Revolut vs N26Ive been using Revolut and N26 for a year. Revolut beats N26 in all but one aspect...here's why:Cards: Revolut provides virtual visa and physical maestro cards. The N26 virtual card is a maestro card, lot less online stores and shop terminals accept the N26 card.Acceptance: the Revolut card is accepted almost everywhere in Europe and Brazil. In Brazil, the Cielo terminals, which are about 50% of all terminals, do not accept wireless payments with my mobile phone. They do accept payments with the physical Revolut card. All other terminals in Brazil accept payments using your virtual Revolut card in your phone. I was NOT able to pay with the N26 virtual card almost anywhere in Brazil. The N26 card is useless un Brazil. The N26 card was also rejected by some European airlines like TAP. KLM and Ryanair accept both In Europe, I was able to use both everywhere I tried.Customer service: neither of them has a phone number to call. Both have a chat. In my experience Revolut has more extended, global opening hours than N26, waiting times seem to be equal. The clear advantage of Revolut is that you can send your query, close the app and open the message thread when an agent answers. N26 has a technical problem with this. Often when i receive a notification that they answered, i tap it but its impossible to get back to the messages and actually see their answer.Access: you can install and use Revolut on 2 phones. So if your phone breaks or gets stolen, you can still access your money. With N26, if you lose access to your one ""paired device"" you are screwed. You can install N26 on 2 phones but only 1 can be your ""paired device"". If try to do anything with a device other than the paired one, N26 wants a confirmation on your paired device. So installing N26 on a second device is useless. Both have a idiotic 2-step verification, so if you lose access to your phone(s) you cant do anything on your laptop because they will be sending verification codes to your phone. This is also annoying if you use different SIM cards.Security: Both have bad reputations blocking accounts, disappearing with the money and making it difficult for clients to get their money back. Both should work on this. Beyond that, this is the only point where N26 beats Revolut. N26 is a licensed german bank, so your money -up to 100k EUR- is protected by the EU deposit protection scheme. Revolut is a financial service provider, not regulated by the protection scheme. N26 left both the UK and US markets closing hundreds of thousands of accounts. Not a step that increases trust.Purchase protection: I dont know if N26 offers purchase protection, basic Revolut doesnt. I see users complaining about it, read where you put your money...they are clear about the basic package not offering purchase protection.Other: Revolut sent a physical card to Brazil within a week. Which is really cool. I dont have a physical N26 card so I cant compare. I can compare to my former idiot, address obsessed belgian bank ING, that still thinks its 1960 and people spend their lives living at one address. If you lose your Revolut card travelling, you can order a replacement for max 25 eur postage, to any address. This gives a kind of ease of mind .while travelling abroadReaction to N26 comments your aggressive and threating reaction is quite telling. I AM a citizen of the European Union. I opened the N26 account as a registered resident of an EU Member State. My experiences using N26 services come from spending time in Brazil as a tourist, not as a resident of Brazil âï¸âï¸âï¸.","Hi Ma, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We do not offer euro accounts in Brazil or allow a customer to register a Brazilian address to a Euro account. If you opened your Euro n26 account whilst you were resident in Brazil then this will have also been a breach of our terms and conditions.We would normally recommend to order a card for your account before travelling as it also functions as a back up for your account in cases of theft or loss.

Tim Stolzenburg,The app doesn't send confirmation emails out. So I'm not able to use phone pairing or order a new card. When reporting a stolen card the app asks me for the token number on the card which I don't have since it's on the stolen card. From there on you end up in a loop of madness with no way out.

Angel,the bank is legit...but they have weird procedures to unlock the account....that u have to got to atm etc... weird.at that time the nearest ATM was 15 Km away and I had no car. so I could not use my card/my money to buy things online. other bank do no need this.UPDATE: 1 EURO FOR FAST MONEY TRANSFER IN SEPA AREA? REVOLUT IS FREE...JUST SAYING,"Hi Angelo, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear that you have not found the verification process convenient for you. The process with the ATM is required to grant access to your account via updating your phone number. This helps us to keep your account secure as it proves to us that you are in possession of your bank card and know your pin number.If you were to also lose your card we have other processes we can follow.As we are a mobile bank we do not have a branch that we can request you to visit, this process is effectively the equivalent and can also be achieved all around the world.

Juan Esteban,"Bad experience that led me to a big debt, everything because their politics and customer service is horrible bad and you have nowhere to physically go and do the reclamation. I had a double charge on my card and after I tried to get in touch with the store and did everything N26 asked for, the bank just cancelled my account and flagged me as a defaulter. AVOID THIS BANK, it will cost you more troubles than benefits. If you are looking for oline banking you have better options (BUNQ/REVOLUT/LYDIA), N26 is just inefficient and and untrustworthy.UPDATE: They refused to even present the chargeback to MasterCard (which I donât really care since N26 should be responsible for this) and they cancelled my account, preventing me of using my cards, account or anything related to it (I canât even login). Worst service ever.","Hi Juan,Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear that you had a negative experience when trying to resolve your payment dispute.

Thomas,"I created N26 account about a year ago and have never used, meaning I didn't provide my tax details. One time I decided to check N26's cards â what cards they offer (type, fabrics, etc.), just wanted to compare their cards with Revolut's. I allowed myself to be guided by the app and as the result I ended up with the request of issuing a card for me. Why did I do it? Because I wanted to check their app flow and UX (user experience). Due to DARK UX they tricked me and issued a card for me without me being truly aware of issuing a card. Well done N26, you can trick people!Let's get to the point: the fun fact is that I couldn't issue the card as I didn't provide my tax details. But it didn't stop N26 from charging my with card owning costs. Do you see where I'm coming from? They literally were charging me monthly for a thing I couldn't use! How would you name such behaviour? I name it SCAM.I ended up with a due amount for two months card subscription I have never used as I couldn't and didn't want to, and for some account termination costs. Am I'm going to pay it back? NO WAY! N26, you should be investigated. In my country there is a special organisation which fights off such murky companies.","Hey Thomas, Thank you for your feedback.To order a new card, it is not necessary to provide your tax information. Itâs only necessary to follow the steps in the app in Card Settings - Order a new card - Confirm the color (if you have a subscription) - Check your shipping address - Confirm the request with your confirmation pin. After this confirmation, the card is sent to the address that is registered on your account. â¨If you signed up for a premium account, the account is activated right after the verification step and the first monthly fee will be charged after 15 days.

Neil,"Quick story. My account was garnished due to a mixup. I cleared this up immediately with the creditor, who instructed N26 to lift the block. Twice. 9 days later, my account is still frozen â with all the terrible consequences that go with. The conflicting information I got from N26 is that the creditor's message, which is one sentence long, âneeds to be reviewedâ or âhasnât arrived yetâ. Hereâs a tip for you, N26. If one of your customers tells you theyâre unable to buy food, medicine or pay rent because youâve frozen their funds, maybe speed up the âdocument reviewâ process? The lack of empathy and prioritisation on the bankâs end is breathtaking.I've cancelled my N26 You account and will be switching to a rival bank.Sure, N26 markets itself as a cool, modern bank.

And the worst thing, there is no number to call which eliminates all accountability of the customer support agents.

We're sorry to hear of your dissatisfaction with the level of service you have received. In the cases of a missing bank transfer the process is dependent on whether you sent the transfer from your N26 account or are expecting to receive it into your N26 account. If the transfer was sent from your N26 account you can request customer services to open a payment investigation to trace or request the recall of the transfer. If the transfer was sent to your N26 account then you would need to contact the sending bank to open the investigation. We would not be able to trace it from the N26 side. I also kindly suggest to make sure that the name and IBAN indicated on the transfer is also a perfect match. Business names, nicknames or similar can cause delays or the transfer to bounce.Whilst we appreciate you may not yet received a reply to your emails, for data security disclosure of information regarding your account is handled via verified chat in the app.Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",2021-11-30,2021-11-30,1.0,0,2021,Negative

Zen Aringazin,"I am international student and come to Germany for the first time, I opened N26 account for receiving monthly payouts from my blocking account. So opening account at N26 was my big mistake and it took months to resolve it. So firstly I have opened N26 account, all worked well for 2 days, however after first payment from blocking account (on third day), I have lost access to account. I wrote to N26 support team, it took 3 weeks before I have received an answer from them. N26 support team said that they cannot provide service to me, they did not even give reasoning!!! Moreover they asked me to not write to support team anymore, cuz they will not help me. I was shocked, imagine i came to new country and received answer like this!!!! I have not used N26 or other German online banks, I am international student, just why they closed access to my money??? Moreover they forget to ask what to do with the money in account, it took another 1 month to transfer funds to another bank. I would recommend to stay away from this bank if you are international student","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Business-Customer,"The quality of customer service is very variable. Most of the times it's unfortunately very bad and time consuming. If you are stuck, the best option you have is reaching out to their Twitter-Support-Team. Yes, you've read that correctly: Their Twitter support is better than the actual one in the app after you logged in. In our eyes N26 does not understand, or simply does not care about needs of business customers - regarding static limits for both business and personal customers, their poorly designed service and their unfortunately non existent internal processes to resolve issues. Even when their actions are harmful for their customers businesses, they will only care if you make your case public. We had two very bad experiences this year and are about to stop working with N26 in 2022. Today I asked their support, if we could make an appointment to discuss whether or not N26 would be able to fit our needs in the future and how this could be done. The answer we got was, that an appointment could be done, but they do not see why this would be necessary. We could just ask in the chat. The quality of the conversation would be the same. Means: They weren't even able to escalate this very kind request to a higher support level. Let's try an attempt on what we see here: N26 can not care about us or other customers too much at the moment. Customer support has to be as cost efficient as it can get. That's because customer satisfaction is no major KPI for investors. Growth and diversification are. Building up a multi language customer service is simply no easy task to do. From a strategic standpoint of a company this means, you will put most of your money in new commercial products (e.g. insurance), marketing, branding and protecting your brand (the twitter team) because it's more efficient and cheaper in comparison to be able to reach investors requirements for new investment rounds. As long as the level of new customers is high enough, customer churn rates can be put aside. You could say bad service is inevitable, because otherwise no new money for N26 and therefore no N26 at all. N26 received new investment money at the end of 2021. Maybe there will be a point on their roadmap to balance this out. But actually, it's not too realistic, if you know a thing or two about how investments in startups work and how overreaching investors can be in terms of theirs invested companies roadmaps. They are currently in a series e investment round, which means they met all investors requirements for at least five rounds. Which also means they are at the end of ""bulk business"". Next thing to do would be to make everything even more profitable by making processes more efficient (most of the times that means everything is getting worst for customers unfortunately). You can not really bypass this process if you are funded, because investors want to secure their funds and get advised profits as soon as possible. In conclusion: If you are just doing simple banking - N26 is cool and has a lot state of the art features other banks aren't able to offer. If you need to work with your banking partner from time to time (eg. as a business) N26 is currently not the right partner of choice. Simply because they are not able to meet individual needs at the current state.I hope this is in some way helpful for people who are thinking about contracting with N26. All the best for you N26. Hope you will be able to break free from pressuring investor relations or even find a way to get everything working anyways so you can finally provide customers a level of service that is more adequate.","Hi,Thank you for taking the time to leave your detailed review and feedback regarding the N26 business account.

Beatrice Schmitke,"Worst bank experience I have ever had. I was stolen in a scam on March and opened the refund process in the same month (according to EU law you can do so until 8 weeks after the transfer). N26 kept saying that the beneficiary bank was not replying, even though I had contacted them and they replied me in 3 business days. After my 8 weeks were done N26 closed my investigation without further details, and sent a generic response as usual. I opened a new case, since I had gotten the reply from the beneficiary bank and knew they were indeed replying. N26 took the money from my account (15 euros) for the investigation fee, and opened a new process. When I asked costumer support about it they took almost one week to tell me that they did not have any open processes. Then they started a third process just to tell me that the beneficiary bank had replied and since the funds were no longer in the scammer's account (of course, if you take six months to finally get in touch the funds will not be there), there was nothing they could do. I asked them to open yet again a new process and do their damn job, and have been ignored ever since. I am pretty sure they received the money back from the beneficiary bank and just kept it for themselves. Awful bank, almost no costumer support, complying with scammers. Honestly, don't waste your time trying to get anything done with them. There are way better banks.","Hey Beatrice,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review. We are very sorry to hear of the outcome of your transfer recall and understand that you may have found the process and communication around this to be frustrating. We recommend to never send bank transfers to unknown recipients online. In most cases the fraudster will transfer or withdraw these funds within the same day, often within minutes. This can make a positive outcome less likely.To help prevent occurrences like this in the future we also recommend to report the fraud to your police force. It is also unfortunate that the receiving bank did not comply with our request or provide us with more details regarding your transfer. As we are the sending bank, we cannot force the receiving bank to reply to our request. For data privacy reasons the receiving bank is also not obliged to provide that to us. This may also relate to ongoing police investigations that may be security sensitive.We are sorry if communication around this process was not transparent and that realistic expectations were not set. If you would like to make a formal complaint please email complaints@n26.com from your registered email address detailing your claim.

Stephanie,"I'm having a bad experience with bank N26. I requested a new card because I lost mine. My card was supposed to be delivered on the 14th of November. But it didn't happen. I got in touch on the support chat. And the assistant reordered me a new card, and I asked Can you check what happened? I got the answer  âOnce the card is delivered it is handed to the post office, we are not able to track it. And the point it is. My address is correct and with all necessary information. And now I have to wait another 14 days for my card to arrive. I need my car as soon as possible. Iâm very dissatisfied with all situation.","Hey Stephanie, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry to hear that your bank card did not arrive. Whilst we appreciate that this may be frustrating, it is not possible to track a letter that is sent with standard local postal service. Tracked courier delivery is offered for an additional charge. As we cannot ""see"" the exact cause that a letter has not been delivered the best option is to cancel the card we previously sent and send a new card with a new unique number. Some of the most common reasons for missed deliveries are incomplete address details or customers using addresses shared by multiple people.For example, in Germany most local postal services will not deliver to an address if the name on the letter does not match the name on the postbox.We're sorry if this has caused any inconvenience.

V. Polat,"I opened an account with N26 two months ago, I have had the amount of a loan that I have taken out deposited into it. In the beginning it worked as expected. Until. I got a message that my account for routine checking was blocked.

wabedave,I have a new phone and a new number. I couldn't log in because you can only login with a verified phone or get access via sms code. Both cases didn't work because of the new phone an new number. I contacted the support and they told me I have to withdraw money and they will ask me how my I took from my card. I did that and they asked about my card token number and my ID number. I told them my token and ID number and the amount I withdrawed but they said it was the wrong ID number because I just got the new ID and they only have the data of my old one. They couldn't help me out furthermore and closed the support Chat. Now I still have no access to my account.,"Hi Wabedave, We are very sorry to hear that a solution was not found when you were last in touch with us.

Sven,Stay far away from this company. I made the mistake to assist my 74 year old mother authorizing her account. Apparently my assistance was a violation of the terms of service. The account was closed due to this violation but after I topped up her account with â¬50 The account is closed and there is no way to retrieve the account funds back after an account is closed. I have addressed this issue by email and support chat. N26 support is very arrogant and not willing to help.

Selen,"This is where you get leaved by the company, when it gets really necessary to get help. I really don't and never recommend this bank for anyone. The service you get via chat is so so bad and you can get sure, you will stay there alone and without any solution, in case you are not able to use the app for example, you stand there alone and its never possible for the team to solve your problems. I had married and changed my name, such an easy process caused that I had to reinstall the app and never was able to reverificate my phone again and so never able to use my bank account.

It isn't until something went really wrong where I experienced the really stressful and limiting side to N26. And all control was taken away from me. The way the system is set up means that beyond simple malfunctions or general questions the support team have absolutely no power. They did their best, but I might as well have been talking to a bot. The delays in dealing with my issues have never been clarified beyond ""we are experiencing delays"". And after over a month I have no clear indication of when this issue will be fixed.

Tibor,"I had used N26 â¬ account since 2019 and had been fully satisfied with it. I used it last time on a holiday in Spain in August 2021. After returning, N26 requested to confirm my address as my debit card was expiring the next month. When I tried to confirm it, the app showed access error. Actually it did not allow anything to do, unlock card, make payment, etc. When I contacted the customer service in chat, they referred to an email I received, and bluntly disconnected the chat. 3 weeks later I actually received the email writing:""We recently identified a substantial violation of our terms and conditions agreement through improper use of your account. Therefore, we are required to terminate your N26 account pursuant to Â§ 19 (3) of the General Business Conditions on an extraordinary basis.""They never replied to any of my emails asking what violation I made. Obviously, because I did not.It's a shame that N26 bank gets rid of legitimate customers with false claims to violation of terms and conditions.","Hi Tibor, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

Bernhard,"Worst experience ever. Tried to increase my daily withdrawal limit, which is possible at every other bank in Europe. Customer support told me this is not possible at N26! I tried asking and explaining customer support multiple times that I urgently need access to my funds but customer support did not care at all. After asking that I need to speak to her manager I got some random information that support is busy and callback could take 24 hours. I wonder if this behavior is even legal, will speak to my lawyer ASAP next Monday.Basically N26 is denying me access to my own hard earned money in a situation of emergency due to some random general daily limit.","Hi Bernhard, We're sorry to hear that you have been inconvenienced by our withdrawal limit.

Isis Baines,"I can't recommend N26 as a main bank! I was very convinced of N26, that has now changed. If you have a real problem with your account, you will not be helped. Customer service is impersonal and poor. Information is not forwarded and there seems to be little to no communication among each other. In addition, there is no way to get in touch with someone personally, which means no telephone customer service, for example. Therefore, it is very difficult to clarify and solve a problem. You always have to communicate with new employees via chat. These had in my case (there were 7 different!) all no idea and could not help me. Again and again I was told that the issue was passed on to the specialist department and that I should please be patient. Meanwhile, the second week comes to an end and nothing has happened! That is simply bad. In any conventional bank would have helped faster, I'm sure! Even a fax from the lawyer with the note ""Urgent! Please submit immediately"" was forwarded only after two days. I have within 9(!) working days, 7x the issue to explain again and after almost two weeks I was told again today, the processing could take 4 working days. However, the processing already takes 9 working days and I was already told about the 4 days two weeks ago. It is unbelievable. N26 is not a bank you can rely on. You should probably always have an account with another bank. Although I was initially enthusiastic, I now appreciate a ""normal"" bank very much. You can go to a bank that is not purely an online bank in person, you have a personal advisor, you can talk on the phone - the communication is better on many levels!","Hey IsisThank you for leaving your feedback.

I did not have the feeling they wanted to help me at the beginning, I just received a ânoâ. Thus, I rephrased mu question a few time and tried to get more details out of their support.

Efua,"Everything was fine until I had my bag stolen- At the first opportunity I contacted N26 to inform them and was told that as I had lost both my paired device and phone number I would need to complete another verification call to regain access to my account. A couple of weeks later (I had to wait to obtain new ID to complete the process), I completed video verification successfully and immediately regained access without any issues. A few hours later I was locked out of my account with no explanation from N26 about what was happening. This happened on a Friday afternoon so I tried contacting them a few times and eventually decided to wait a little as I was confident it would soon be resolved. I was wrong. The following week was spent desperately trying to get answers from chat support. Though I was a premium customer, I could not contact them on the phone and kept asking for someone to give me a call so I could try to speak to someone about what was going on. Not only did they refuse to contact me but then agents took to lying to me about what was going on and when I could expect to hear from someone about my account. On one occasion I was even given a falsified 'callback code' and told someone would contact me within 24 hours. On another occasion I was told to have a little more patience and assured someone would be in touch by the end of the day. On another occasion I was asked to email about the issue which I did immediately-  to this day I have never received a response to that email or many of the others I sent in increasing desperation, as I tried to access my account or at the very least the money that was in it. Finally, 10 days after being locked out of my account, at 5pm on a Monday, I received an email informing me that my account was being cancelled in accordance with a section of the terms and conditions that literally did not exist. I had not done anything wrong- the only transactions I had completed were transfers to and from an account in my home country (UK), rental payments to my landlords in Germany and card payments for basic everyday expenses. In fact one of the very last items on my account before this happened is a salary I received from N26 themselves- yes that's right I am actually a former employee (though I opened the account before I actually worked with them). That means in this instance not only have they treated me appallingly as a customer but as an employer they are essentially withholding money that I earned legally and fairly under a section of the terms and conditions that nobody is able to properly cite, let alone explain. Anytime I try to follow up I am given niceties without action which I think most of us can agree is not helpful when you are experiencing financial hardship BECAUSE of an institution. As a result of all this I am now at risk of homelessness; unable to pay for health insurance, content insurance or legal insurance- because all of these things were tied to my account- and have even had to borrow money for food because I have no access to my own money or account. The account was also my only one in Germany, so now I am also unable to receive payments from my clients ( I am now a freelancer). The most frustrating thing is that all of this is happening for the simple fact that N26 cannot be bothered to implement proper recovery tools and instead find it easier to close an account than to come up with better processes to prevent this from happening. As a former employee, I know for a fact that they simply do not care to work towards improving this situation for their customers and instead hide behind the excuse of carrying out 'regulatory checks'. Other banks (both traditional and those in fintech) are also obliged to carry these out, yet they manage to do so in a fraction of the time because they have prioritised the acquisition of the necessary resources. N26 does not have the resources and though their expansion is rapid they lack integrity and therefore do not care to resolve these issues in a timely manner. In the short time I was there I observed a clear culture of distrust and contempt for the customer, systems designed to frustrate, poor data practices, abysmal security and an unwillingness to fix any gaps in their banking processes if it was not directly linked to an increase in their profits. As a customer, I now understand something that I strongly suspected but could not quite believe while I worked there- N26 simply do not care about you, your money or your financial security and no amount of pastel colours and targeted advertising will ever be enough to make up for the gaps in their service that create this reality. Avoid them like the plague or risk experiencing something similar.","Hey Efua, We're sorry to hear that your phone was stolen then this ultimately led to the closure of your account.

Sandi Huynh,"Terrible customer service with generic answers. I've requested an account closure on Oct. 14th and still on Oct. 25th as I write this, they have held my money in the account with no way to transfer it to my other bank and have not given me proper updates. I tried to transfer my funds before even requesting the closure which they blocked. Now they keep telling me the closure is ""in process"" but won't give me an ETA or transfer my funds. They close the chat as soon as you don't respond within 30 seconds with no resolution and I'm not even sure it's a human I'm speaking with through support. I may have to get my lawyer involved but this is pretty ridiculous to treat a customer like this. I thought about returning to N26 as I try out different banks for my business account but it looks like N26 is one to stay away from. Never again!","Hi Sandi,Thanks for taking the time to leave your review.

Malte,"I think the N26 account is basically great, clear and simple user interface, clear, inexpensive with surcharge options if desired, quick and easy registration. The (chat) customer service could not convince me.  The employee couldn't help me directly and had therefore promised to call me back.  I didn't get it, the same thing when I sent another cover letter.  In response to repeated inquiries, I could not be given a time window in which I should receive feedback on my concern.  Only that the matter goes to a specialist department. Since I once worked in a call center myself, I consider this a very poor customer service, it is very important to set the right expectations with the customer in order to create clear relationships and avoid unnecessary contacts. But well, the cheap / fast online account must also have disadvantages. I don't know if you should trust this if you have a real problem, for example abroad.Regards,Malte","Hey Malte, Thank you for your feedback about our app.We are sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support.We'd be happy to provide you further assistance with any issue you may be experiencing, we are very active in our social media channels.

Pierre,"I've been a very long customer at N26 and always have spoken highly about the experience, the new way of thinking about banking and all the benefits that come from that. Unfortunately due to new products and portfolio, longtime customer now (if they at one point in the past with the old products) decided to downgrade, they no longer are able to upgrade to one of the products that are now in the portfolio. I don't understand why customer that are one of the firsts are now punished for reasons they can't influence. Especially since they might be willing to actually upgrade and pay monthly fees which should result in extra money flow for the bank itself.Sadly, for me this means that N26 will terminate my main banking account, with no chance of me being able to stay a customer (I already talked to customer support over the chat 4x times).","Hey Pierre, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Mokshini,"I have been with N26 for 3 years, and I have no bad memories of the customer service at the time I started out, and have been happy with using the N26 App since. But - I changed my phone last week and was then not able to log in to my App on the new phone. Since then I have been on 5 long and tedious chats with N26 staff in a call centre. There is no phone number to call. Not only, as part of the verification process did I have to go out and find a cash point to make a withdrawal to prove I was who I was which was a pain, but I was promised a call back in a time period of 'up to 24 hours' on Saturday afternoon. It is now Monday afternoon 14.00 and I am still waiting. The call centre staff just say I need to be patient - 'there are a lot of calls on hold'  - 'someone will call me soon'. For an online bank to be so in accessible is just not good enough in my opinion, and in the meantime I am unable to access my account or complete transactions. I am not at all happy.","Hi Mokshni,We're sorry to hear that it took longer than expected to receive your callback for your phone number change.

Once you get an agent, each will have a different approach to solve the issue and most of them will be irrelevant address to send documents will differ from one agent to another.3. For an internet-based Bank, they should also accept digital submission of certain documents, which they donâtâ¦. And donât even tell you beforehand.4.

Doro,"(Note: I'm comparing N26 here to other fintech banks, not ""regular"" banks.)I had to change my phone number and use a new ""un-paired"" phone. This was a ridiculously long and OFFLINE procedure. First, I had to chat to a support agent. They then told me I had to go withdraw money. What the hell? I thought this was a 100% online bank? And why should I have to withdraw money to confirm my identity? Also, because I can't access the N26 app, I cannot check where the nearby compatible ATMs are. Where's the logic here? Afterwards, I had to provide my ID card information, the withdrawal amount, and a 10-digit number that is on a card YOU'D HAVE TO ORDER SEPARATELY. Luckily, I had this maestro card with the required 10-digit number, but normally, you'd only have the mastercard which does not have this 10-digit number. You have to order the maestro card separately.I thought that was it. But no, I was then told I would have to WAIT for a PHONE CALL. No instant SMS verification. No, a human would have to call between office hours within 24 hours. Absolutely ridiculous. If you're in an emergency or lose your phone, you are stuck. There is no added value to the web version of the online banking since you have to confirm your login using the app. As a customer, I expect to have 24/7 access to my account. These kind of offline, old-fashioned, time-intensive procedures are unacceptable for a supposed ""100% online, innovative"" fintech company.There are much, much simpler and faster ways to to do this. I also have a bunq account and with that I can login in a browser using my email, or phone/QR code, or phone number. Easy. Multiple options. No paired device, I can install the app on any device and access my account at all times. No ridiculous offline ATM procedures and waiting around for phone calls.It's 2021, but N26 is stuck miles behind other fintech banks. (Recently they've been showing off their instant bank transfers. Seriously? So many countries and banks already offer this. This is hardly new. Just shows how behind N26 and Germany are in terms of banking.)Will be closing my account soon and only using bunq and Revolut. At least those banks know what ""100% online"" means and offer better and more practical service.Edit: You'll see from the reviews below that N26 defends these procedures as security necessities. N26, security is important, but I trust your competitors more because they understand speed and practicality and let me retain access to my account. They achieve the same goals in a much simpler and faster fashion and are equally if not more secure. It *is* possible to do things better and faster while maintaining security. N26's procedures are more of a reflection of Germany's overly-complicated protocols fetishism than of security requirements, which becomes clear when comparing N26 to competitors and when reading the other reviews here.","Hey Doro, Thank you for taking the time to leave a detailed critique of our security processes.  We're sorry to hear that you have found this inconvenient. The process you have outlined is to grant access to your account if you do not have access to your registered phone number or paired phone. We are bound by regulation to verify that the person requesting access is the account holder.

If there was a situation where a customer did not have a bank card we can follow alternative verification processes.

Further, customer service refused to block the merchant in question and did not refund the transaction.I will avoid N26 in the future! Thanks for wasting my money!","Hey Martin,We're sorry to hear that you had a negative experience when reporting fraud to us and requesting a chargeback. Card payments are covered by Mastercards chargeback process in cases of fraud. This can mean that customer services cannot instantly reverse a transaction as it is part of a dispute process that is handled by a specialist team. To prevent further charges you would need to arrange to order a new bank card with customer support. You will need a new card number to keep your account sure as a fraudster could make further payments via other routes if they have your card details.

In short, I was scammed, and N26's customer support was not helpful at all. It took them weeks to decide whether or not they had to refund the money that was stolen from me. Initially, they said they weren't liable for it at all. After contacting them about five times, I finally managed to get them to cover about a third of the money that was stolen from me. I'm convinced that if I'd been at a bigger bank, there would have been much smoother and fairer procedures for dealing with routine fraud cases.","Hey Miranda, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.

lfh,"N26 Metal is a great overall card, however do not use it for Airline delays or cancellations. Allianz the insurance company behind their insurance policies has some strange outs for cancelled or rerouted trips. My flight was at 06.30 from Stockholm to LAX via Amsterdam on KLM. At 06.30 Airline informed us a Tank Truck had made contact with one of the plane engines and they needed to review with operations in Amsterdam. At 08.30 the Airline informed us that we will be rebooked on other flights to our destinations. KLM rebooked me on Aeroflot getting in about 8 hours late and due to other issues I can not fly via Moskva, so for 3 hours was on the phone with different KLM related entities. Finally a great call agent were able to book me on Finnair getting in at around 5 pm instead of the original 11 am KLM flight. Excuses from Allianz so far is hilarious ""we do not cover cancelled flights by airlines that are in default"" ""we do not cover cancelled flights on first leg or any rerouting"" So the only way I would have qualified for compensation from Allianz/N26 Metal is if the same plane was delayed more than 4 hours and I could only take the same route.

L.S.L.,"Unquestionably a modern bank, the app is well prepared and transparently functioning. A major drawback, however, is the lack of telephone support, which is only available to premium customers, but should be independent of that, especially in larger problem cases. And the written chat is a bit time-consuming, as the response behavior is rather viscous. All in all, I'm satisfied, haven't had any significant problems so far, but I'm a low-key user with harmless transactions, so to speak.",Pending,2021-09-05,2021-09-05,4.0,0,2021,Positive

Leonard A**,"And Axos is the Bank that 94% of Trustpilot reviewers are rating with ONE STAR.  We have been waiting for nearly three weeks now on a simple money transfer sent from the USA  to the ABA routing number that N26 provides on their website (n26 dot com/en-us/blog/funding-your-account#external-bank-transfer-ach) for deposit to our confirmed N26 account number.  The routing number (122287675) belongs to Axos Bank who disavow anything but a debit-card arrangement.  Nevertheless, that is the ABA# that N26 provides and it should connect to one of their customer's own accounts. But in this case, it is not. By their own website N26 confirms that ""N26 Inc. is not a bank and does not accept deposits or provide banking products.""  The money is stuck somewhere in the system and the finger-pointing between Axos and N26 is becoming very confusing and frustrating.  We are actually quite alarmed.","Hey Leonard, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. It sounds like a SWIFT has been sent to an N26 account in Euros. We would be unable to track an incoming SWIFT transfer, these payments can go through several banks before reaching us and it's possible that some of the intermediary banks reject the payment.

Anna Michalska,"An hour after I have created an account I have realized I don't need it in the end and I wanted to cancel it. I have tried for 2h  with the chat. Was never connected with a human. Called the line and asked to close the account. I was told I will get a link, I did. The link was not working. Send an email. Did not hear back from them, even a confirmation email that they have received it. Called back the next morning. I was told they can not help me cose i did not agree to be recorded, I was never asked if I agree to be recorded, the first time i called and the second time i called. I told this to the person I was talking to, she told me to call again and agree to be recorded. When i told her how bad my experience was so far, she told me if i don't like it i can choose another bank..., after waiting in the morning 15 min i managed to get connected to the chat and was told to send it an email. Funny that the mission is  ""Our vision is to build a bank the world loves to use. Additionally the app and notifications coming from it, are all over the place. Scarry product to use. Imagine if i had real problems.","Hey Anna,We're sorry to hear that and happy to advise you further.We have an account closure process which you can access from within the N26 app.Alternatively you can close your account by sending an email to support@n26.com from your registered email address with the following closure form: https://docs.n26.com/cs/Customer_Termination_letter_EN_N26_2020.pdfThis cancellation form includes:- A declaration requesting the closure of your N26 account on a specific date, or âas soon as possibleâ- Your full legal name- The IBAN of your N26 accountPlease note that if you have funds remaining in your main account or your Spaces sub-accounts, weâll also need an IBAN of another bank account within the SEPA area for us to transfer your remaining balance.You can find more information about this on our Support Centre here: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/personal-information-and-data/how-to-close-my-accountBest Regards,Rose, Your N26 Support Team.",2021-09-21,2021-09-21,1.0,0,2021,Positive

customer,"The app itself is not bad, and itâs a good bank to start off with when moving to Germany initially and you are looking for an online bank.It took me a long time to find out how terrible the customer service is, because I never needed them the first couple of years. After three months of messaging (because they do not have a contact number, nor a live chat, in this day and age), they have continuously misread my request, asked me to provide certain information only to then tell me the information is not sufficient, tell me to provide certain documents that are completely irrelevant to my case (a name change confirmation when I have never had a name change).All of this happened in a way where they would reply to my messages once per 1-2 weeks, and I would then reply on the same day (usually within the hour), and they would then let me wait again some weeks, etc.All in all, perfectly fine bank if you donât need any help from customer service. I dearly hope they will start seeing soon how much of a roadblock their customer service team is creating though, so they can start becoming the competent modern bank they otherwise are.","Hey,Thank you for getting in touch!First of all, we're sorry to hear that you've had a negative experience, we would be happy to take a further look into this for you.There are several ways to get in contact with us:1) You can send us an email at support@n26.com.2) You can contact our live chat (https://support.n26.com/en-eu/getting-started/other/how-to-contact-n26), which is open from 7am-11pm Monday - Sunday.3) If you are a premium customer there is a dedicated phone line.

Myra,"I wanted to open up a new bank account at N26. The interface and offers seemed user-friendly and trustworthy at first but that's where my positive experience ended. The automated registration process got stuck on the ""Verification"" step. I reached out to customer support but it turned out to be extremely difficult to get quick and effective help. You first have to bypass the automatic chat bot and the FAQ section. No phone number. After finally receiving a short answer from a human that I should use the chat icon in the app I realized that there is no option to do so (as I was still stuck in the registration process in the app). So I wrote an email in addition and tried to reach someone again via the chat. The chat person only told me to be patient while they check the case. After almost 3 months of my first inquiry at N26 I received an email saying the following:""Thanks for getting in touch!I've taken a look at your sign-up and currently we're unable to offer you an account due to legal requirements.Please note that our Customer Service cannot help you any further or make an exception for you.Have a great evening,""So my critiques are the following:- Slow, ineffective, unfriendly and non-transparent customer support- Waiting 3 (!!!) months to open a bank account only to receive a generic response saying I cannot open a bank account due to ""legal requirements""I would have really liked to know what legal requirement impeded me to open a new account. But their email basically asked me not to contact them again.","Hey Myra, Thank you for your interest in opening an account with N26. We're sorry to hear that your request was declined. As a fully licensed mobile bank we are legally required to fully verify the identity of every applicant before opening an account.

Jay,"Worst bank ever. I have account in United States. I used to direct deposit my salary. I wanted to transfer money to my local brick and mortar account so I could pay rent, but one can not transfer money from the account to another bank. When I called customer support they told me to pull money from another bank.So I tried to do ACH debit from another bank and N26 rejected the transfer, twice. Then they sent me an email accusing me of using my account for business purposes and closed my account.I provided them with alternate bank routing and account numbers to transfer the money. It has been two months and they haven't done it.Four phone calls to customer support and numerous emails to their back office and still nothing.I am afraid they are just going to steal my money and I will have to sue then in the court to get it.

I experienced the horror of having to deal with N26 personally and how poorly it is ran.  Do not trust your financial resources with this startup. It will only result in loss. In May I opened an account. 2 months later, no cards were received at my residential address which was correctly provided. I contacted support to send the card again. 1 month later: no progress. They offer to send the card express without any cost. Next, they decide to debit my account in full for the shipping (â¬30). I have various conversations with support again and 3 weeks later they return â¬25.

Brit,"Waiting for over a month to get money back after closing account.First they locked us out of the account without notice and without reason. Since there was no way for them to find a normal solution or communicate in any kind of way, we've decided to close the account and send the money to my Dutch bank account.So after the two months that we weren't able to access our money and pay our bills, they take over a month to close the bank account and send our money (over 4000 euro's) to our other bank account! They really are Inhumane and we've gotten into a LOT of trouble because of them, since they don't allow you to pay your bills.And what is pretty dodgy aswell is all the good reviews all at sudden the last couple of days (from people who've only have 1 review), cause a month ago it was only bad reviews.JUST GIVE OUR MONEY BACK N26, YOU'RE JUST ONE BIG SCAM WHO REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS","Hey Britt,We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.In accordance with European banking regulations, N26 must carry out regular routine compliance checks on user accounts.

Viajante,"I would like to share one experience I had for visibility to all in this internal process.Last week, on the 13th of August I've lost my phone which I had in there my N26 account linked to the number I've lost.This week, on the 17th-18th I tried to change my account phone number to a new one I got.There's a process to withdraw some money from an ATM and after I confirm in the N26 support chat I did my part, it is expected to receive a callback 24 hours after by N26 to make this change effective. This callback never happened and when I reach out to the support again, I was informed that I should redo the process because of a failure of the N26 team. This is very sad that your team didn't accommodate the impacts of failing and I had to. Now I have to proceed with an option that will disable my card functionalities, minimum in the next 12h.Can you please guarantee this doesn't happen again and I can have my account back as soon as possible? You could imagine that having the mobile lost is hard enough to then handle with such a difficult process to change my phone number.These customer experience details are the ones that define the quality of the different banks in my opinion.","Hey Viajante, Thank you for taking the time for leaving your review.

Hillel Posner,I am sad to say N26 is a scam. They said they would open an italian bank account for me. I opened the account and funded it with 1k. The account did not have an italian iban as promised and they will not refund the 1k. They claim the account is under review and I cannot access the money until the review is complete. They won't say what the review is for or how long it takes. I waited a month. NO RESPONSE. I just lost 1k. Don't use N26,"Hey Hillel,Thanks for leaving us a review.

Caro,One Star is too much tbh - i tried to apply for an N26 account and the app froze on my mobile and i wasnt even able to register - i told them maybe 10 times and have had zero response or acknowledgement - not so much as an email and when i did eventually speak to a customer support person they couldn't even help me - i have since learned that ALOT of people have the same problem so they are obviously loosing a lot of business - very dissappointed - they clearly don't have customer service at the heart of the business proposition so probably not being able to register is a blessing in disguise,"Hey Caro, We're sorry to hear that you had a negative experience when applying for an account with us.

Ms Lopes,"I have no idea why this bank has good reviews online, it's absolutely the worst! I joined because it stated that I could have different currencies on my account. When I got paid for my first invoice with the company I'm working with, nothing showed up... Then I had to go through the hell that is trying to speak with their customer service... The first time, someone answered straight away, only to tell me they couldn't help and would put me through to someone who could. It was incredibly confusing to know if I was being put through to someone else because I kept getting a message asking if my query had been resolved, first when they said they were putting me through to someone else and then every time I was checking with them if I was actually being put through. Then I waited for quite a while before someone answered and when they did, they mentioned I couldn't be paid in foreign currency, unless it was done through Wise, which was not explained properly when I joined. I thought I was losing my mind but when I did a quick google search, one of the results from N26 themselves (an ad on Google) confirmed they memory I had of them oversimplifying the offer. Luckily I did a screenshot because I just tried to search again and that result is no longer there. I didn't retrace my research again because that will take a long time but I did my due diligence before selecting this bank, and my decision was based on the fact that I could easily receive money in a foreign currency. They said that they money should bounce back in a week's time and if it didn't, then the sender would need to open an investigation to understand what happened. I wanted to make sure I had all my details right so I went to find my chat history and obviously it's nowhere to be found. I then started a chat and waited 30 minutes before anyone answered. When they did, they felt like they were a machine to be honest and were completely unhelpful at first. Finally I got them to give me some answers and they said that they had my chat history but couldn't send it to me. SERIOUSLY??? I was livid... They said that the only option I had was to select to save the current chat after I ended it... By then I had ZERO trust in them so I did screenshots of the entire conversation. At the end of the conversation, I mentioned that I couldn't see an option so save the chat and their response was literally ""You have to end the chat first."" Surprise, surprise, I ended the chat and there was NO OPTION AT ALL to save it. Good thing that I knew not to trust anything they said and got the screenshots earlier. Regarding the payment, they asked me if I'd received a message from them regarding foreign currency transfers. I had no memory of that, so I went to check my messages and I was correct, I never received that message. The only message that was similar was one informing me that they would introduce fees for SWIFT transfers in foreign currency, which had nothing to do with my issue. In terms of the amount of time it would take for the money to re-appear in the sender's account, this time they said it would be within 7-10 working days, so who knows, if I ever ask again it might be another random number...I have now created an account with TransferWise (also known as Wise), which so far seems a lot more transparent. Fingers crossed!In summary: DO NOT GET AN ACCOUNT WITH N26, THERE ARE ENOUGH HORROR STORIES ON TRUSTPILOT AND ONLINE THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PUT YOU OFF.","Hey, Thank you for leaving us a review.

Jimmy Humania,"STAY AWAY FROM THEM, IT'S A SCAM. I CANNOT ACCESS MY FUNDS IN MY OWN ACCOUNT. HERE'S MY STORY ON:I created an account with them a few months ago, paired my mobile phone number, and also 100% KYC verified as they required.The verification of my account was successful and was activated. Then last week, I made a mistake by transferring some fiat funds over to my verified N26 account. Well, I received the funds in the account, but now I can't withdraw them to another bank account of mine.Their mobile and web app locks me out and asks me to reverify again (unsure why) to access my account. Unsure why again?I was already verified, how did they ""Unverify"" me all over again?Okay no worries, so I can just reverify with my documents and gain access back to my account, right?Well, I have tried over 10 times to verify within the app, and also via 3 video verification with their representatives. But no luck so far!I show them my passport during the video verifications, but somehow they don't verify me. No clue why!Do the video representatives think I'm an AI now with a valid ID document in my hand? This logic certainly is not understandable by me at least. It's hilariously dumb! How can someone not verify when I show them my documents!So now, I cannot access my account from the past 9 days, nor will they get back to me with a logical response. I'm blind-sighted and have no clue as to what is going on. Their live customer support keeps on chanting the same ""dumb"" things over and over again ""we have escalated your case to the teams"".I'm pretty sure it's not being taken care of, cuz it doesn't take a ""100% online bank"" 9 days to acknowledge a human email reply to a customer. Does it?To be clear, I don't mind the funds' cuz it's just 4 figures in euros. OR could be something is incorrect within their internal systems. However, an update would be nice on how to resolve the issue. I'm willing to collaborate and provide anything they need to prove my identity (ALL OVER AGAIN). lol Here I just intend to make you all aware of my own experience with this fiat fintech bank in particular. Think twice!  Other people encounter similar sorta issues too. Don't have time to research all and bring them forward here, and can't share links here. But google themSince I don't have large enough online followers, I request you to share this with your audiences, so that they are aware of why CRYPTO > FIAT.

Olivia La-Traviata,"if you want someone to hack your account and take all your money: choose N26, they will answer you I do not see anything strange !! Everything looks normal!

TK,"I am an international MBA student from Turkey, I am Syrian and I have recently arrived in Berlin/Germany, and I was excited to start my life as a student there. I have to open a bank account to receive my payouts from the blocked account and I was recommended to use N26. I liked the flexibility and the plans, so I started the registration process and downloaded the app as instructed, and just as everything was going smoothly, I was interrupted by a message from them telling me that they won't open an account for me until I obtain a new nationality. This was very upsetting and unnecessary, being Syrian doesn't automatically means that I am a criminal, Syrians have been living all over the world and had opened many accounts in different parts of the globe since many years ago, even before the war happened. There is absolutely no need for such discrimination and treatment, I don't care if there was a bureaucratic, diplomatic, or whatever reason for this. Different conditions should apply to different people, especially those who are perfectly legal and following the rules accordingly and to the letter. Just because I am Syrian, that shouldn't mean that I am unworthy of an online bank account. I came to Germany seeking better and fair treatment, only to be shocked by your discriminatory behavior and rules. If we are to develop as human beings, we should start by setting aside unnecessary obstacles in the face of honorable and potentially loyal customers, as a progressive method of banking, I was quite shocked by your backward way of dealing with people, you can be better by projecting an image of tolerance and acceptance rather than fear and discrimination. I know I can't change anything by writing this review, but at least I can say something about it and share it with other people to let them know that Syrians are people just like everybody else, we have responsibilities and obligations and we need to secure our finances just like everybody else. We deserve it, we are worthy of it and we should be treated fairly.","Dear TK, Thank you for taking the time to leave a thoughtful review. We're sorry to hear of your disappointment in being declined an account with N26. As a fully licensed mobile bank we are legally obligated to fully verify every sign-up before opening an account. This process is not possible in person so we must follow this step diligently. We verify a potential customers identity by checking their ID with a detailed profile of the correct security features of their documents. This helps us to protect against fraud or identity theft. Unfortunately this means that some forms of ID are not currently supported. We are always adding more documents to our supported lists. When we update our lists they can be found online here: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/verifying-my-identity/how-to-prove-my-identityBest regards, Ben, Your N26 support",2021-08-16,2021-08-16,1.0,0,2021,Positive
Cassandra,"As a whole, the actual app itself is quite pleasant, and I have never had any big issues with that side of things itself as a secondary small savings bank.

Well I could not access to my account and i was trying to receive assistance for 3 days !!! There is not any phone number you can call in this case scenario... Either by chat were assisting as the live chat was very busy too, so I was waiting waiting and nothing !! Finally they replied by live chat and they asked me to leave to find an ATM to do a withdrawal and then come back and try to contact n26 live chat again... SERIOUSLY!?!? Imagine I used to use N26 as my MAIN account linked with my job!! All my cash and savings were there !! And could not access or have any visibility of it to make payments, nothing. And in my case I had the money in saving folders so just me can move that money through the app to the main acc. Was very frustrating ! In this urgent cases they would need to have a normal phone number or line where you can call and explain to obtain help ASAP !

We're sorry to hear that our account may not meet your current requirements. As a mobile bank we are focussed on card and contactless payments. We have found that the numbers of merchants in Germany accepting card payments in stores, restaurants and bars is increasing rapidly.

It is accepted everywhere that accepts Maestro payments. If you have found that a merchant that did not accept the Maestro, they would have been attempting the transaction as an EC payment.

Henry,BEWARE!!!  I opened an account with N26 curious to see what internetbanking had to offer. (Not so many advantages it seems to me).    Anyway i had â¬20K in a 1 yr fixed interest account. One day i was sent a message asking me to explain the origin of my funds. Since they came from some investments i sold i was happy to comply. However i then received an email telling me my account was being closed in 6 weeks with no explanation as to why!    The support on the app was absolutely hopeless and they just ended the âchatâ when i mentioned the issue.      No explanation has yet been provided why my account was closed or how to retreive my â¬20k in my savings account.     As a result i have had to start a legal process ( costly & time intensive) to retreive my funds.   This is not really what you expect from a Bank! Being an online Bank means that you can never address these kinds of serious issues in person with someone.    Therefore i hope this reveals to everyone that N26 is not a safe or reliable place to keep your money.

NR,"Ordered a N26 metal card, my current classic card was immediatly blocked and declared stolen without me being informed about that. All my online pending purchases were cancelled due to the blocked card and I'm left with no way to pay normally using my N26 account for 2 weeks until the new card arrives. Nowhere in the N26 app was any warning or any information that the current card will be blocked as soon as I order a new one. The N26 support was useless (they told me to use Google Pay!), they said that was the normal procedure... When I complained about that procedure being illogical and putting customers into deep trouble, they replied by listing the awards they got for the N26 app design?!? I have never seen a bank instantly cancel a customer's card when you order a new one, that makes no sense. The normal procedure is to cancel the old card when the new one is activated. I am a 4+ years, paying customer. As I am an expat, I depend on that N26 card a lot.

When you order a card from the app as âStolenâ or âLostâ, for security reasons the previous active card will be permanently blocked to avoid unauthorised transactions. This will also block all the payments linked to this card. â¨â¨If the card is ordered as âBrokenâ, the previous card will remain active until you activate the new one. â¨Before your N26 card arrivesÂ in the mail,Â you can begin using itÂ through Apple or Google pay.

When I reported it on the same day, they let the fraudulent transaction not only pass once, but also authorised a second transaction from some Ukrainian online payment company (I am based in Ireland).Not only do they refuse to issue the chargeback as they claim the service was fulfilled (ie: money transferred) despite the fact I've never received any service or goods, they also don't even address the fact that they let the transaction pass twice.As the fraudster used an Online Payment platform who was able to provide a dodgy document explaining that the money was successfully transferred, N26 considers that the transaction was legitimate: the service I paid a huge amount for was a money transfer!Throughout weeks of contacts with the support, I was fed incorrect information as I was told that my request was approved and that the chargeback decision was made by the card issuer. I also experienced advisors leaving the chat without my consent while I had additional questions.Online banking is convenient and cheap, but when you have an issue, it is worth what you pay for... nothing.","Hi Vincent, Thank you for taking time to leave us a review.We are sorry to hear that youâve had a negative experience.At N26, protecting your account is our top priority.

In accordance with European banking regulations, N26 must carry out routine technical checks on customer accounts. As a regulated institution, this helps us ensure that the funds held in your N26 account are kept safe and secure.The majority of the time, these checks are done very quickly, without you being able to see them. On occasion, this may take a longer time, during which your account may be temporarily unavailable to you. This process is overseen by a dedicated team specialised in conducting technical reviews of this nature, who work diligently to minimize any disruption. For this reason, our N26 Customer Support team is unable to provide further information on your account via live chat, or expedite the process.Please be patient with us as we complete the steps, and our team will contact you proactively once the technical review process is complete.Best, Pieter.

Marisol Vargas,"The nightmares nightmare. They took at least 6 hours per day since one month to verified my identification, telephone, etc. I have lost a lot of energy, time and money. The application is mostly of the time  out. Each agent in the live chat gives to you a different information. The people at the phone are so desagreable. The most horrible experience during one year. They took 120 euros from the card each month 10 per month for nothing. i couldnt use the account correctly. Now they are asking interest and i denounced them.

Rowan,"I thought my account was closed 2 years ago, at the time it would not have had a negative balance. Moving forward, to two years later, I have a new phone, live in a different country and don't have the same number. N26 have sent me numerous threatening emails stating that they are transferring me to a debt collection agency, are charging me interest on my overdue balance from two years of unpaid fees and have sent me various other types of threatening correspondence. I contacted them regarding this and was willing to follow data protection (as far as what is legally required from the data protection act in Ireland).However, they rudely presented me with three options:1. Use my card at an ATM to verify my identity (I no longer have this card)2. provide them with ID and do a video verification - as far as I am concerned they are in the wrong and I have no desire to provide this company with my details. 3. Send an email cancelling with my N26 Iban which I am unable to access. When I politely explained that these were not viable options to the member of staff assisting me their exact response was:""In which case - just ignore all N26 messages, your account will eventually be closed down automatically and your debt transferred as per the T^Cs you agreed to upon account opening.""Avoid avoid avoid!

Maya,"Edit 3: I got my money back once the legal department took over my case. I advice to separate your money into several spaces and to lock the card in the app when you don't use it.Edit 2 : MasterCard just confirmed to me the existence of Mastercard Zero Liability Protection Policy. If you handle your card and your data responsibily (which is my case as I still have the credit card in question, and didn't disclose any financial information neither of the secret code to anyone), you ar enot liable for any financial damages that arise from fraudsters or theft. We just need to report it to our bank, in my case N26 who will responsible for this. We are proctected as a cardholder in any case. So N26 customer service has been lying to me since the beginning. I did ask for all the transcript and the audio recording of the call received where they confirmed they can't do anything for me, and I m still waiting for all of these. In addition of lying, they are not respecting GDPR laws or banking laws that include Zero Liability Protection Policy.I m escalating the case to MasterCard, consumers union and the right authorities within Germany. This will cost them more than the amount of my fraud but apparently they prefer this way.---------------------------------------Edit 1 : as you can see by their reply, they are totally incompetent. I still have my credit card with me, no one knows my code and yet it is still possible to have your money withdrew at the opposite of the world and you ll receive a standard answer that is NOT responding to your claim. Avoid this bank at any cost. ------------------------------I would not recommend this bank as there is no security for the customers when there is a fraud happening. My card has been duplicated, I have it with me. I live in Berlin. Some withdrawals of money happened in Kingston Jamaica. Iâve contested these, and went to the classical process of reimbursement through N26/MasterCard. The money has been reimbursed.And then a few weeks later, the money has been taken again from my account without my permission and without asking my bank prior of it. Iâve tried to get in touch with someone from N26 - very difficult, this whole process I spoke with min 10 different person from the customer service, not even the Legal department despite my request to get in contact with them. They explained to me that it was a charge back by the ATM merchant in Jamaica. They contested the reimbursement and took the money from my bank account without asking for approval before. Totally normal. Mind blowing. Despite itâs a fraud, someone steal money from me itâs I the victim who needs to compensate the loss. I would not recommend this so called bank for anything in the world. I need to press charges in order to get my money back. Against who? I have no clue , they wouldnât let me know.","Hello Maya, Thank you for taking the time to leave a detailed review. We offer a chargeback service through Mastercard. This allows customers to dispute transactions made by someone other than yourself, or when a mistake occurs on the merchantâs part.At N26, protecting your account is our top priority. Thatâs why we offer a variety of features to keep your money safe, including the option to block your card in seconds, activate or deactivate payments abroad, enable or disable online transactions, and set spending limitsââall right from your N26 app. We also offer biometric authentication for a secure login, 3D Secure technology for safe online payments, and a âDiscreet Mode(new tab)â option to securely access your account in public. Instant push-notifications help you stay up-to-date on all your incoming and outgoing payments, so youâre always aware of whatâs happening on your account.Plus, weâre always improving our internal processes and tools to detect and prevent card fraud. Here are a few ways you can help to protect your account from fraud:- Only use ATMs that belong to trusted banks - Only place orders with trusted online retailers and websites- Change your online passwords and PINs regularly - Never trust text messages or emails that appear to come from N26 which ask you to provide your card details, account details, or include suspicious links. N26 will never ask for your card or account details outside of the N26 app or the N26 WebApp.- Change your card settings within your N26 app. For example, disable online payments, ATM withdrawals, payments abroad, and set spending limits that correspond with your regular spending behavior.- Avoid making Magnetic Stripe transactions if possible. Instead, opt for the safer NFC chip-based or digital wallet transactions where available.- Always keep your card in a safe place.Best Regards, Peter, N26 Support Team.",2021-08-03,2021-08-03,1.0,0,2021,Positive
J.Marcos Bernal,"I followed a signup link on another app which contained a 30 euro promotion. After opening the account no mention of the promotion.

Zoltan,"[21.06.2021] UPDATE: N26's ""response"" to my original review (used to be a generous 2 stars) is anything but a genuine attempt to help. They must have copied and pasted it from the wrong template as it's completely irrelevant. I'm not surprised, just even more disappointed. [17.06.2021] Very poor customer service. I've contacted their Customer Support twice with the same issue I had and although they appear helpful and tell you via chat that they would look into it / escalate the issue and revert via email, but they never do. It's not just unprofessional, but rude. The only response you get from them (which proves that it's not a case of not having your correct details) is the automated opinion survey request.

Alex,"TL;DR:+ Opening an account takes about five minutes.+ The base model is free.+ Both the web- and iOS-app are very intuitive and easy to use, can't say anything about the Android-app.~ The support chat is not very useful unless you reach the right person.- If you use the free plan and have to reinstall the app for some reason, you'll be locked out of both your bank account and any associated cards.-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --FULL REVIEW:I switched to N26 about a month ago and I was really happy. The setup is quick and easy, there are (in the lowest plan of course) no recurring fees and adding the card to Apple Pay was done in minutes.Unfortunately, there was (or still is?) a small bug in my account (the app had a big popup telling me that I have to add funds (which I did right at the initial setup) to activate the card (which I was already using in stores)), which led to me contacting the support. After waiting about 20 minutes in the chat and then talking to them, they suggested that I remove my connected phone, uninstall the app, restart my phone and reinstall the app afterwards. Didn't make much sense to me as the error appeared on my PC and Mac as well, but sure - I thought - why not? Can't get any worse - I thought. After removing the app from my account through the web interface, I was automatically logged out from the website and therefore the support chat. No big deal, I just logged in again and started a new chat. Waiting another 20 minutes, explaining everything to a new employee who then just transferred me to the previous employee (alright.. makes sense... I guess). After explaining that I successfully went through all the steps mentioned above, they told me I had to re-verify my account, because there is no other way to register the app. For the re-verification they had to un-verify me first. I thought no problem, shouldn't take long, didn't take long when I created the account. Unfortunately the email to verify my account never arrived. So I logged in again, started yet another chat, waited another 20 minutes and explained everything to employee number three (this time they didn't redirect me to the first employee for some reason). This (so far) last employee told me that they ""escalated"" the ticket, but the support is closed for now. Apparently they'll contact me next week. This is my main bank account where I receive my monthly income and from which I pay all my bills and subscriptions.If you don't (want to) use physical money and are happy with a credit card or Apple/Google Pay, this is probably the bank for you. Compared to R*****t, N26's web app gives you the same features as the phone app, which is a huge plus in my eyes. If you choose one of the premium plans, you also get insurances and other extras.For now I can't fully recommend it, because my experience with the support wasn't the best so far, but we'll see what the next days bring.UPDATE: Â±0 Stars1. The email arrived after about twelve hours and I was able to re-verify my account. Unfortunately we're just back to where we started as the initial problem wasn't resolved.UPDATE: +2 Stars1. Since the re-verification from the first update was done within 24 hours and it didn't cause any issues with automated payments or subscriptions, I'll add one star for it not being a big issue after all.2. The second star I'm adding is for the quick reply here on Trustpilot which was followed by a short email conversation. I'm hoping we can resolve the issue in the next week.3. Changed the recommendation.UPDATE: +1 Star1. The problem was solved after talking to the support for a while. It took some time, but I did get help right after posting this review and then it went really well.2. For now I will leave the review the way it is, because it represents my experience correctly.3. Added a tl;dr, because the full review is way too long. :D[I'll probably update/change the review after using N26 for a few months.]","Hey Alexander, Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

Marija Milicevic,"I just literally got cut in the middle of tryping and trying to solve my issue when a customer agent just closed the chat, seriously unbelievable. I was patiently trying for weeks to open my account over and over again, after constantly getting blocked on the first step & error messages of the account opening. I guess it turned out I can't open my account as I am not being able to verify myself, but when I asked the agent (Sean if I rememeber correctly) how am I supposed to do it if I literally don't have an option on any step of the way to do it, he just kept replying me generic, automatised answers and then just closed the chat. Wow what a customer support. So besides him that was pretty useless and rude, the other agents were pretty polite but were literally driving me in circles for weeks. How is it possible for my account opening to get canceled after a first step, supposedly because unable to verify me, if I didn't have a chance even to add almost any of my data/upload my documents/or video prove my identity?

Alan Mitchell,"I am based in Italy and opened a N26 account a couple of months ago.At first basic card receipt and payments which worked fine so then I decided to start to use it as my bank with which to interface with an investment App. I organised a transfer of funds from a non-EU European pension trust on 10.5.2021 to both N26 and also to an Italian bank where I have a traditional account. The Italian bank credited the transfer on the next day!  N26 instead sent me an information request on the 11.5.2021 which was fine and to which I replied in an hour. Then â¦ nothing. It took 3 support chats and a phone call to the German N26 number to solicit a response which I eventually got on the 18.5.2021 for more information.  I supplied that on the message service within 2 hours and then â¦ nothing.I am seriously getting worried about the whereabouts of my incoming SEPA within the N26 banking organisation because of the poor quality of the support service and slow speed of reply.  What can I do when the Support Chat yesterday provides no me with no information other âMy supervisor is handling this and will send you an email soonâ but then that email does not arrive?.  I certainly donât want to be waiting any longer for a euro SEPA and I donât want to be writing on Trustpilot. If anybody has any ideas please let me know.  I have thought about www . ft . com / news - tips / which seems like a financial investigative journalist group from the FT to see if other UK citizens in Europe have experienced similar problems with pension pay-outs post Brexit into Europe and explain my problem or perhaps  to the complaints page of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and gives helpful information.  This is after all a German bank with a license to bank in Italy.In all events my advice is IF YOU VALUE having EASY ACCESS to your FUNDS, you should really think twice if N26 is the right bank for you. It is definitely no longer the right bank for me, I will be CLOSING MY N26 ACCOUNT just as soon as this situation is resolved.",Pending,2021-05-20,2021-05-20,1.0,0,2021,Positive

DHall,"Today I went to purchase a $23 car wash and my card was decline. The alert on my phone said âcard lockedâ. I go in the app trying to figure this out because I didnât lock my card, and I simply canât even see my card as an option. I call customer service who tells me that my account is frozen for technical review! I received no notice, no call, no email NOTHING!!! Over $7,000 in my account that I canât use. Customer service is worthless, they refused to tell me why, informed me there was nobody I could talk to, no number to call. I could only wait for a random email to come at an unknown time from their âInternal Review Teamâ. When I asked the rep what his name was, he hung up on me. I am moving to Germany this year and thought this was a great choice to start transferring funds and direct deposits. So I opened this account beginning of April. BIG MISTAKE! I filed a complaint tonight with the FDIC & contacted an attorney. This caused significant distress as my husband lost his job due to COVID and Iâve changed my direct deposits here for my salary. There isnât another account to deposit funds. My bills arenât going to clear and my checks (according to the second rep named Vincent) will be returned to my employer. This is simply unacceptable. Now I have to reopen my old account with my American bank. And change everything over AGAIN. Thank God for my lawyer, first thing Monday morning, heâs taking action against this bank. As a consumer we should be given notice and cause for this type of behavior on our accounts. They should be banned from conducting business in the US. Iâm writing my state representative to let them know about this. Avoid this bank at all cost. Find a reputable bank with lawful policies. I just want my money back, close this account and never look back.",Pending,2021-05-09,2021-05-09,1.0,0,2021,Positive

And it is also my right to be informed about the real price.,"Hi Martin,N26 does not charge any fee whatsoever for SEPA transfers.

As another post stated chat is closed without warning too. Cannot even get my money back so maybe need to resort to legal action. Appalling and the only reason 1 star given is that Trustpilot does not allow zero stars. Worst bank I have ever experienced in my life. No phone contact available to speak to someone who can talk to me and sort out the problem.Well thats it....finally after several months I have been able to get my deposit back and they have closed the account.

Dmitrijs Filipenoks,"I was chatting with one of the agents and as he was not able to understand my question I've asked for a callback. He said that he will make sure that I will get one within an hour. After 2 hours I wrote again and asked if something is wrong why I'm not getting a call from them. He apologized and ""promised"" that I will get one soon - never happened! Next day I wrote again and another agent said that he will put high priority on my request and they will call me - it happened! Begging was fine( I was not expecting 5 star service) and later when I was asking specific cases about security of their bank(as I'm planning to close other bank accounts, transfer all funds to one bank and use only one bank, I thought it might be N26) he started to say ""I don't know"" and ""you sound suspicious asking such questions"" and offended me verbally! Obviously I'm not planning to transfer 1k but amount is higher that's why I have to be sure that I can trust this bank. No offense, but I would definitely not use this bank as my primary bank and will start now to look for an alternative bank(luckily there are more online banks in Germany).","Hi Dmitirijs,We're sorry to learn that you had a negative experience with our Support Chat.All of our agents are trained in the same way and to the highest possible standard.

Elisabeth Nilsson,"For marketing themselves as an ""international"" and ""innovative"" way of banking I am truly disappointed in their operations.For someone with a frequent change of location and footprint I would rather opt for another bank.- Online facial recognition mechanism was a HASSLE to get to work, took me approx. 2 weeks of declined trials- BIG Hassle to change address, especially if you figure out after a while that you need a card (when you move a lot between countries you know that you have a higher or lower dependency of physical cards - hence you might want it in some countries and not in others) (I know this is EU bank regulation --> then please donât use the ""mobile"" banking as a selling point if you simply cannot be more mobile than all other vendors, also I was flexible and tried to offer other alternatives e.g. picking up the card in person at their location in Berlin - TBH I would rather travel to Berlin and pick the card up in person than having it sent to an address where a stranger lives in another country of my current residency)*Edit1* , new areas where I donât think N26 meet expectations- UX bug in the verification process that I have highlighted to customer service without seeing any solution on (No expectation management screen during verification - the app gets stuck in a ""limbo"" between two pages)- UX bug in their online customer support chat. If you re-orient within the N26 webpage (e.g. goes from the starting page to card services pages) the Customer support chat restarts. Hence you need to stay on the same page within N26 throughout the full support errand. This was particularly a problem when the support agent asked me to go and look at another page. This means one has to restart the support chat and most likely will be given a new support agent.- Inability to provide customer service to customers without physical cards (also if you read my comment above this is ironic as they cannot send me a physical card...), A digital bank should have a more solid verification system in place - if you rely on physical cards you are not a ""digital"" and ""International"" viable option - sorry to break it to you.*Edit 2*- re-verification was not approved within 8 days (5 working days) which is what they promise on the website.*Edit 3*- Changed review from 1 star to 3, as I got access to the video verification (previously not accessible in my device due to above stated UX bug).

Kathy,"I was very happy with N26 until their recent policy change that slashed the daily withdrawal limit from 2500 euros to 1000 euros (a reduction of 60%) completely out of the blue. This means that the maximum amount that I can withdraw from my bank without paying fees has been slashed by 60%. There is no changes to the number of free withdrawals either, so now N26 is 1) significantly more inconvenient, and 2) more expensive. When I asked customer support for some assistance or relief, they told me that if I wasn't happy, I could go find another bank (vertbatim). It felt like a slap in the face given that they've fundamentally changed their service after I signed up. Shame on the product and policy teams that instituted this change, and shame on the customer support team for essentially telling a customer to f*** off.","Hey Kathy, Thanks for the feedback.The new withdrawal limit reflects changes we are seeing in how our customers are using less cash today, and is another measure that allows N26 to better ensure the safety of your account. Having large amounts of cash available to withdraw can be a security risk, so we made this change in the interest of safeguarding our customers' accounts. You can also choose to set your own withdrawal limit directly in your N26 app.Best Regards, Peter, N26 Support Team",2021-04-29,2021-04-29,2.0,0,2021,Positive

customer,"I am very disappointed with N26. My company is trying to pay me the month of MARCH and it has been rejected by N26. It has been almost a month I am talking to people to solve this problem and they donât care. They say that my account is normal and donât do anything about it! Itâs very serious! I need to be paid! I already sent a document, as N26 asked, from the bank of my company telling they are trying to pay me and no success!

Daniel Bochert,"Everything is smooth and easy until it isn't. N26 doesn't exel in customer service. Processing times are slow and it has become a habit to not answer inquiries and don't even send receive confirmations. The service has always been underwhelming, that's not new. It just reached a new bottom. The chat ""experts"" are not experts and more often than not fall back on standardized anders instead of individual help. And saying "" because of corona"" is a terrible excuse for low performance. In my case I simply asked N26 to transfer a hold amount after a fight with a municipality that left my account in freeze. And while any ""not-online-only-bank"" is fully able to execute such requests within a few hours, it would take N26 several workdays. So no, not ok. Plus: If you don't qualify for a premium account, you will pay more in monthly fees and charges than having a N26 metal account. The logic is impeccable, the service poor.","Hey Daniel,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.First of all, we're sorry to hear about your negative experience and happy to provide you with some further advice.We offer several memberships to ensure that N26 is the right account for you, this includes our free standard account to our more premium accounts which boast plenty of benefits.

JF,"I reported a fraudulent transaction with my N26 Debit Mastercard and NEVER heard back from customer service. They told me I would have to wait at least 6 weeks before my case would be reviewed. Further, customer service refused to block the merchant in question and did not refund the transaction. N26 may be convenient for European ex-pats, but if your account gets compromised you will simply be out of luck. With a reputable Bank or Visa/Mastercard, in the event of a fraudulent transaction, your money is refunded immediately after making a case. Once the case is closed, if the bank determines you are at fault, then you will be charged again at a later date...This is not the case with N26...Really too bad, as I genuinely like everything else about N26!

Jan Willem,"So, you are lured in with a ""free"" account. So far so good, even though you only get a ""digital card"". This in itself is not too bad for use with online shopping and for 10 bucks you get a plastic card mailed to your home. Well, in theory! Before you even open an account you provide all your personal data (KYC and AML requirement). Once you have done so, including passport photos, you get to activate location data on your phone for ""extra security"". Right. extra tracking that is. If you decline, you get logged out and need to log in and start over with the passport info, etc. In all, the app is just a data phishing tool which leaves you with no way to open an account if and when you do not grant full access to location and everything else. If you want to resolve this by contacting support, there is no support, no even an email address or chat listed on the website. You have to ""move to the app"", which only works once you provide all details and access. I get it, there is no such thing as free lunch and there are stringent regulatory requirements with regard to personal data. However, just grabbing the info and not even providing any support is a bridge too far. I want N26 to immediately delete and remove any and all information I have provided from their servers and files and cancel the account opening procedure. However, I can not even communicate this to them directly! It will be a cold day in hell before I entrust a company like this with even a single cent of my assets. Any issue you have, you just lost your funds because they can not be contacted. Do yourself a favour and avoid N26. There are better and more transparent alternatives.

Jenny Bachmann,"Interacting with the customer support via chat was a pain. The 2 individuals I chatted with (my chat timed out twice in the middle of the conversation) used the same scripted replies which made it harder to communicate because they sometimes did not really specifically match my questions or were really repetitive. (Reading twice in a row ""I totally understand your frustration."" in the exact same wording while they obviously did not understand was really annoying). It felt a little like talking to a bot after all. When 1 person diverged from the script, they were rude and unhelpful, mocking the questions I was asking (""If I close my account, can I immediately open a new one or is there a delay / downtime."" - closing and then re-opening was represented to me as the only option for turning a Flex account into any other account). They also suggested that I could just go open an account at a different bank eventhough I explicitly stated that I liked N26 and I was hoping for a solution rather than being shown the door.[edited some for grammar / spelling mistakes]","Hey Jenny, Thank you for the feedback.

Kevin Agyeman,"I am in the middle of Costa Rica basically somewhere in nowhere, depending on a rental car to get to the next city, and all of a sudden while the rental company tries to charge the deposit I lost all my faith in n26. The rental company was not able to charge the deposit so I checked my N26 app , it was telling me that there was not enough cover for the payment, which was not the case - there was enough money on it. I was super chilled by this time because I was sure this is just a small bug and that N26 support would fix this in a minute. I contacted the Support and from there on everything went downhill. After I explained my problem literally the first answer I get was âI think this is something my colleagues have to check tomorrowâ I was shocked .. I than explained that it is urgent to find a solution, the N26 employee than resetted  my card and told me to wait 30minutes and that it would work afterwards. As may can imagine it didnât, I ended up having the worst night in a baaaaaaaad baaad hostel somewhere in nowhere payed with luckily some cash I had left ... and no explanation since on what kind of problem that was..","Hey Kevin, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We sorry to hear you've had issue with a car hire company. Often, car rental companies will take very large deposit before hiring out a car. As the card linked to your account is a MasterCard Debit card as apposed to Credit you would need to have a large amount of funds available to cover the deposit. Once the rental company takes this large deposit they can also hold on to it for 30 day before releasing it back to your account.

Each time they and myself needed to spend tons of time to communicate with their idiot customer service to get the money back. Finally I decided to cancel the account in 2019. Until now the account still there. They can't even cancel the account, no matter how many times I write email or contact with the support!!!!!! Update after seeing the response: yes, to reply email to close one account you can spend time since 2019 until now.

Alex S,"3 years with the bank and no issue with them, itâs a great modern bank with one of the best interface on the market. The only thing that is disappointing and really sad is that they are moving all the perks that the âstandardâ account had at the beginning, and now if you really want to enjoy the best of the account you have to choose any of their subscriptions. I have been also waiting for more perks like cashback or rewards for using any of their cards in Germany, but apparently they just do that with other markets outside of the EU","Hey Alex, Thank you for the kind feedback.

Su TuÄcu,"If you want to use digital banks because you're unsatisfied with physical banks, just pass your way.N26 has the most unhelpful customer support and will truly waste your time for weeks on end for minor changes such as phone number. Although I had access to my valid ID, password, ATM card and my paired device, they made me contact them for over 6 times. For just a phone number change, I had to go multiple times to ATM. Where I am in non euro zone, it's impossible to withdraw because ATMs will give you cash advance with 8% fee and I didn't want that for just changing my phone number. So, I go back and the customer support tells me they can reset my verification and it's going to be okay. Except, they don't tell me one important thing. Once you're reverified you won't be able to use your card, make withdrawals or transfers. It's truly utter nonsense. I'm so over with this bank.

Tim M.,"This pioneering online bank really has no idea what they are doing.  When i first started with the bank, it took them they couldn't get me my card the first two times they tried to mail it to me.  After the first time, they didn't apologise, nor did they offer me a complimentary express shipping.  I asked something like - since ive not gotten my card for a month, could you maybe thrown in free express shipping?The only way to actually get my card was to complain on Twitter.  Then they threw in express shipping.  Today, i asked them if theres any way i could get a physical check made.  Turns out, there's not.  There is absolutely no way to write a check with this bank.  I need a check to renew my passport.  And there advise was ""ask the US embassy if they can do accept a transfer.""  It may not seem like a big deal, but the inability to write a check can be a big setback in certain situations.  And of course, their inability to deliver a card is an embarassment.  It seems like they had the idea, ""let's have a 100% online bank!"" and they didnt think too much about the execution.  I plan on changing banks next week.EDIT: similarly in their reply below, they suggested ways to pay the embassy THAT THE EMBASSY DOES NOT ACCEPT.  They really do not know what they're doing.","Hey Tim, Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback. As a mobile bank we are unable to issue cheques.

You can get in touch through chat except the day I needed it they must gave been very busy however a day or two later I managed to communicate through their chat portal.

Anna,"Update: after more than one year I still have the account, and I only use it for payments in foreign value (i.e. not â¬). The normal bank transfers through IBAN from my regular Irish account are free, so happy days and four stars. I still keep my eggs nice and close to me in Credit Union though...Old review from 03/2021:Three stars moving up or down, depending on future events.I read the horror stories posted here, so I was quite suspicious and scared.However, until now everything went decently, with a couple of important warnings, though.PROS:I opened the account in minutesI paid once contactless and once online: instant record on my expenses, fast transactionI received my debit card in the timeframe they had given meApp is fast and easy to navigateCONS:There is a fee for bank transfers (EDIT: Only for immediate transfers through the N26 app. Regular IBAN transfers from my Credit Union are free on both ends). This was not advertised and defies the purpose of having an N26 account: savings on fees! As I am not putting all my eggs in a basket, I need to transfer money a bit at a time to spend it just when it's convenient to use N26. No way I am receiving my meagre wages in a foreign account without in-person office, when reviews talk of sudden account closures with no refund!Also, the fee for receiving my card didn't appear until I received the card. I'd rather have an immediate record of pending transactions to keep track of my ACTUAL funds.In synthesis: let's see what happens. I am no financial wizard, so I will study a way to move money on this account without paying crazy fees. Short of that, I fear that I will have to close the account, which is a pity as the app and payment system work just fine.Updates to come as stuff happens.","Hey Anna, Thank you for taking  the time to leave us this feedback.We are excited to learn more about your N26 journey.

Mariusz Przestrzelski,"I am having terrible experience with this bank. On the 8th February 2021, around 10 months after opening the account it has suddenly been blocked with the balance of  â¬10814.25.

Domenico A Pinto,"Hi there, I loved the experience, the card, and the concept. So when I returned to Europe I was really excited to discover N26. I hadn't lived in Europe for 9 years and find the offering really refreshing. I am currently in Greece, I am on the most premium account/card type they have, the n26 metal. Despite that, I am continuously charged fees when I withdraw money. I am using the ATMs listed on the n26 app. So, regular ATMs. I should have 8 free withdrawals a month, but that is only technically true, the banks can still charge you. Also, the support time, can't tell you where you can withdraw money at no cost, not really helpful, all I am getting is a standard compliance answer: ""n26 did not charge you anything it's just the banks, we can't control them, bla bla bla"". ING Australia had a similar offer in Australia, except it actually didn't cost me a cent, anywhere in the world, regardless of how much the ATM would charge me I would also get the costs incurred refunded. I find this highly misleading.","He Domenico, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback regarding ATM charges. We are aware of the issues with some banks charging for the use of their ATM's. The machine should pre-warn you of any extra costs for withdrawing the funds. We are looking at expanding our Cash26 feature to more markets in the near future. This feature would allow you to withdraw cash from selected shops with no extra costs.

Utku SerinoÄlu,"I opened my Account with N26 7 months ago and I was quite impressed with the fast service and easy signup process. then 2 months ago we opened another account for my wife. She had been using the App and account for all her transactions. Then about 2 days ago she received a notification that her card has been locked. When I enquired all I kept being told was compliance check and all. Shortly after she received an email that her account was being closed. Although it was absurd and not acceptable, there was nothing to do... Then I started to check that if there are some people who have faced same kind of issue. the result is there are a lot of people who faced the same issue. To be honest now we are worried about our money after checking the reviews. it seems that it will be hard to get our money. I had trusted this bank, I use this account even for salary. But after today I will also close my account. absolutely unreliablePS edit after their classical reply: there are %20 bad comment about them but they are still using a template for their reply. They do not say something different in their mails. I'm tired of hearing and reading to the same explanation (regulation , safety, bla bla ).I highly recommend you: change the regular checks you make and make a clear explanation to your customers.We trusted you and only opened an account from you in Germany and now you are asking us to provide another account number in Germany. I can't send my money anywhere right now. In addition, if we look at the comments below, those who give account information are not paid.

At the first sign of any problems the âsmoothnessâ of the app became a problem, N26 hides behind the app, thereâs no way to speak to anyone senior about issues they havenât dealt with. All the transactions I reported as incorrect never got solved or paid back to me, and my complaints were ignored for weeks, and then closed without any action.  I have lost upwards of â¬1000+ but they just donât respond or care. I was never able to escalate my complaints and was told âsomeone would contact meâ, which never happened.

jmofischer,"N26 is basically alright, but there are several points to improve. 1. the log-in time is very short. If you are not busy on the website (because you are running a business and you have check other software such as invoicing and spreadsheets) you are logged out in no time. Why? I am at home, alone, no one else uses my computer. 2. not all transactions are shown in your monthly statements. For example test transactions (where a company tests your card by withdrawing â¬1 and later refund it) are NOT shown in monthly statements. If you want actual details you have to download the cvs/excel files, where minor transactions are shown. This is completely unreliable if you are running a business. 3. you are bombarded with advertisements to take out some credit card or other every time. N26 could be great, but it ends up just being run-of-the-mill.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about the business account.

Lina,"I had a great experience when I was about to open the account. The app is also great to use.However, it does not have integration with MobilePay.dk (most nordic banks have) and the support couldn't provide me any information about that (not even state if N26 and MobilePay are partners or not). They could not even tell me basic info like partnerships of the bank. I felt very disappointed and am about to close my account.","Hey Carol, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback.

Ben,"Joke of a company - don't trust them with your $. Erroneously withdrew 3 separate $500 transactions from a linked external account after the app gave me ""unexpected error"" on the frontend, which were never deposited to my N26 account. Their support chat is borderline useless. Closes unexpectedly if you minimize the window, also closes if you hit a frontend error and you lose the chat connection and any history. Does not appear to be any cohesive notation or CRM happening on the backend as I have to re-explain my situation every time.When I finally reached somebody on the phone about this issue, and provided transaction trace numbers I had to obtain from the external bank, I was on hold for about 20 minutes and then told they could only locate 1/3 of the transfers. I asked for an email or call back with an update by end of day, as I'm still out $1500 at this point. That didn't happen, and I had to then call back the next day, was disconnected from my initial support call, and had to re-explain the entire situation to the next rep.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Ani,"I was sharing a great impressions of N26 as you â I was telling everywhere it is the best bank. But I just faced the issue, I payed the regular rent Iâm paying each month almost 200Â£ on 1st of December, five days latter I got the notification to confirm outstanding payment and I confirmed it, and N26 made another payment. Then I checked it out and it was a double payment. When I contacted N26, they told me it was my mistake and I inserted my pin on 6th of December as well, which is true, but I did that as I though based on the âfake notification of the outstanding transferâ, that my payment from 1st of December havenât been proceeded. I would resolve this issue easy on my own with my landlords, but when I tried to download transfer confirmations, I got the same confirmations with the same date of 1st of December for both of the payments, so Iâm missing the evidence to resolve my problem. And N26 told me to resolve my problem on my own, as they investigated the case and as I inserted the pin, that means it was my mistake. Can you imagine how Iâm currently feeling, like I donât have control over my money, I completely lost the trust. So please be carful, I was lucky it was not more then 200Â£.","Hey Ani,Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.We would like the opportunity to get some further feedback from you in order to investigate this matter and provide you with some further advice.Can you kindly contact us via our Twitter support @N26_Support, we are very active here and happy to chat with you.

Ben Smith,"Terrible doesn't even come close to describing N26.  I raised a number of chargebacks due to online shopping issues.  N26 didn't refund any of them, and did not even reply on most occasions, they just filed and ignored the issue.  Other times they said that because I had bought online before, they assumed all transactions were real.  The app is rubbish, and I logged a complaint about it, and at the same time reported a problem transaction.  I was asked for more information to be sent via the app, which I was unable to do.  I then called in, and spoke to the same person multiple times, and he kept cutting me off, as he said he ""didnt like my tone!"".  I made calls at 17:50, 17:53, 17:57, 18:01, 18:11, 18:21 where he kept shouting over me, and cutting me off when I disagreed with him. He refused to give me his name or make a complaint about how he was handling my call. Complaints I have made in the past were not taken down correctly, and the reply to one of a series of complaints was to send me an email saying they were not going to take any action. Rubbish.","Hi Ben,We're sorry to hear of the experience you have had.We have a dedicated internal Chargeback team who work diligently on dispute cases.

Sandrine,"I wish I had read all the negative reviews I see here before choosing N26 to be my main bank.I recently moved to a new country for a job and opened my account to receive my monthly salary as well as manage spending and savings. Everything went smoothly, until I tried to make an outgoing transfer to pay my rent. I unfortunately forgot my PIN so I requested a new one, which requires a re-verification of your ID.So I proceeded with a re-submission of the same ID that I used when I initially opened the account approximately (3 weeks prior). Since then, I have been literally locked out of my account with no access to the app nor my funds.I have been contacting the customer service team via chat everyday for a week now, and so far I have been told me 2 things repeatedly: - my issue has been escalated to the ""emergency"" team- someone will get in touch with me ""very soon"" or ""in 1 to 2 days"" via my registered email or by phone.After almost 10 days and counting without being contacted at all by anyone at N26 (neither by email or phone) regarding my case, I think it is now safe to say that the customer service team was lying, plain and simple. The most recent turn of events was today, when 4 different customer service support agents just closed the chat on me directly after I asked for a status of my case, and didn't even give me a chance to respond.Meanwhile, my entire income being on this account I am now homeless in a foreign country (and I do not speak the language) due to my inability to pay my rent because of this so-called bank. I have mentioned this several times to them and guess what they've done so far? Yes, nothing. My experience has been an absolute nightmare, and if you ever face a similar situation, I can testify that N26:- will not care at all- will not take prompt action to solve your problemI am incredibly terrified reading reviews of people who faced the same thing and are locked out of their accounts for months. I need my money to be able to survive and I cannot understand that a company that relies so much on technology has such poor handling of their online procedures. Let me not even get started on the VISA card, which I am still waiting on, by the way.To N26: this is an emergency, I need to access my funds. It is unacceptable that a re-verification with the same ID for a one-month old existing account leads to locking people out of their accounts.","Hey Sandrine,We're sorry to learn of this situation.In the event you forget the PIN you have chosen and have not yet received your N26 MasterCard, a re-verification is necessary to ensure the safety and security of your N26 account.

Jamye,"I wanted a bank I could trust and rely on. Banking in my opinion should not be hard. I opened an account, changed all my information for this account. I was told when I would receive my card. The day got closer I hadn't received it, so I called and tried to track...not an option. I spoke with 2 different representatives via the chatting option. Who told me a different date than what I was originally told and my dashboard remained the Same with saying when I should receive my card. The day came still didn't receive my card, this representative told me another date. So now I'm up to 3 different dates of when I should receive my card. Trying to get into a solution I'm thinking I'll transfer money. Well I can't do that because you can only transfer to people who also have this account and you can't transfer out of this account. I was told I could like to a third party specifically pay pal. Nope still didn't work and when I called back I was told you can't transfer without have the actual debit card. I tried overnighting a card, can't do that because that's not an option. I am told something different every time. I communicate with customer service rather call or chatting via message. They only thing that I am constantly told is I'm sorry so and so told you that but that's not an option, you can do that or there's nothing we can do..... I have money can see the money but can't access it. I can put money into the account but can't take money out... I wouldn't recommend this account to my worse enemy. My holiday plans are ruined and all they can say is wait and I'm sorry. I can't wait to get the card so I can close this account.","Hey Jamye,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.First of all, we are sorry to hear you had a negative experience.We advise you to check the following guidelines for our card delivery.

Jules,"The worst customer support ever. I had to contact them 3 times through 2 years and it all resulted in a very bad experience. Once the process of unauthorized purchase took 2 months to solve since the person who was handling my case didn't start the whole process even after getting their confirmation email with info that I should contact them after 12 days. Once I contacted them, they figured out that the person responsible for my case didn't do their job, so I had to wait for another month.Second, the card was sent to the wrong address, because there was again more than one person handling my case without communicating between them.And today was the third time. Yesterday the new card which I had to order was 15â¬, today when I spoke with someone else it's 30â¬. You have to contact them multiple times to get an info or update. They don't seem to understand customers in general. If this is your main account where the majority of your money is then you should not be chasing them for updates or confirmations to your last reply but that should be their main concern to give you solutions and updates as soon as possible.This time was for me the last time I'm dealing with them. I will have to find a better solution for myself because this is clearly not working.","Hey Jules,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.First of all, we are sorry to hear you had a negative experience.

Suanna Parker,"This bank has ruined the lives of my family and I. Back in October, around the 30th, we awoke to our account being randomly closed and we were told that they would not be giving us any further information. I believe the vague reason they wrote in their email was that âwe werenât a good fit given our account usageâ. Something to the effect of that. First off, this bank doesnât have late fees, and that means that if you donât have enough money in your account the charge is simply declined. So, with that in mind what could we have POSSIBLY DONE to warrant a response like this? Well, Iâll tell you, we enjoy using draft kings for sports betting. Which is completely legal where we live and weâve done it since weâve had the account so why the problem now? Well, because we actually won some money this year I guess. It doesnât matter much now since weâre now a day away from eviction. Moving on, so, they sent the check containing all of the money that was in our account and the total was just over 5,000$.Now, anyone thatâs ever had a check over 5,000$ may know that they are impossible to cash without a bank account. We tried to have a friend deposit it for us but said friends bank sent us back a copy of the check and so the saga with N26 continued. Iâll remind everyone that the bank cancelled our account at the END OF OCTOBER which means mere days before rent is due. Great. Ya know, a great big F you from the bank, but it has now been almost 2 months since this whole thing started and we only JUST LAST WEEK got ahold of one of their supervisors who finally got the check reissued. My fiancÃ© had called the bank no less than 100 times in the course of the month of November to try and get the check reissued or get the funds deposited into his PayPal (something they couldnât do of course). Our only course of action if we ever got the reissued check was to take it to a payday loan place and pay over 200$ to cash the check thatâs just over 5,000$. (We now owe 3,000 of it to our landlord and my fiancÃ© has been out of work since November due to Covid since heâs in the service industry). Well, itâs now mid December. The supervisor for N26 said last week that the check was FINALLY reissued and should arrive within 7-10 days (WHO HAS TIME TO WAIT THIS LONG ON THE EDGE OF EVICTION!!!!)This was last Wednesday that they allegedly mailed the check.It is now Thursday of the next week. We got our eviction pay or get out notice last Friday. We have UNTIL TOMORROW!!!!!! Still. No. CHECK. Today. If it doesnât come tomorrow weâre screwed. So, this is my review.Thanks N26! Iâve never been evicted before in my life. Guess itâs one for the life experience books. F-me right? Iâm a nobody in the grand scheme of things to you and your company right? Well, know this, I will tell every single person I know to tell every person they know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK! Oh, itâs a pandemic. In case you didnât know. Thanks. Iâm going to go burn my N26 card now.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Alper,"Apparently, I had a membership with this company.This company did not communicate about the membership fees that were running and had to be paid. I myself did not use the products and services.In spite of the fact that the company never communicated the outstanding invoices, after a year it came to me via a collection agency with additional costs.I still took responsibility and paid for it immediately. The account of the collection agency has not been able to receive my payment and in the meantime, I receive letters from another collection agency with the outstanding costs and collection charges almost doubled. I find it ridiculous that this is not communicated to me as a client on time and that 2 external collection parties are involved. It is also ridiculous that I can't approach anyone within N26 for help and information because they don't know anything about it. They tell me to solve this with the collection agencies.","Hi Alper,We're sorry to learn this.When you sign up for an N26 account, you are asked to pick an account type of your choice.

If you make a payment with insufficient funds in your account, and the merchant doesn't have internet connection, the funds will be charged to your Â card.Â This occurs because the payment terminal cannot detect the insufficient funds due to its lack of internet connection.

Oluwakorede Cole,"I'm moving to Germany from Nigeria and already have my Visa. A friend recommends N26 and says I can sort everything out online. Everything goes well till it's time to verify my identity via a video call. My friend tells me she used her Nigerian passport and work visa for verification so I believe all will be well till I get on a call with some verification expert dude. He does not make it clear that all his questions should be responded to with just yes or no before he starts asking, then he rudely speaks over me when I start responding to one of his questions. Has this attitude like I'm bugging him through the entire conversation. When I show him my passport data page as he asks, He goes that my kind of passport is not accepted for verification. I'm confused so I flip to the other page to show him my Blue Card Visa, in case this was what he really needed to see.

Marcel,"Not sure how many stars I should give this N26 bank. I give them 5 stars for being free, but 0 for customer support!The registration process was flawless. However after I received my Debit card and put 100 euro on the account I could not order a Maestro card and not see the debit card details in the app. (Android but also iOS).Contacted customer support over 6 times via chat.Very slow response. Took hours to get them understanding the issue. But I am patient and persistent.Every time a different answer was given for the same problem.1st person: Unpair phone, delete app etc. This did not work. Opening a new chat.2nd person: You have to make a deposit of 100 euro in one transfer (I did 10 euro first for Debit card and 90 after to get the Maestro card) Made a 100 euro deposit but that did not work either. Again had to open a new chat.3rd person: You have to wait 24 hours before you can order a Maestro card.. Waited 24 hours, but nope no Maestro card.Non of these solutions worked. They escalated my issue. After a few days waiting for the 'expert' to solve my problem I get this solution: Please unpair the phone and delete the app... ticket closed bye bye.Seriously?!?! The problem had already been resolved in the meantime because it was clearly a problem with the app and not with my device.Customer support needs to get some proper training and needs to become a hell of a lot better before I give this 5 stars.*EDITAs a response on the N26 comment below. You did not read or fully understand my review.. Just like customer chat did not understand.I am Dutch, and I have â¬100 on my account. Yet I was unable to order the Maestro card. The option to swipe to the left/right at cards > get an additional card > was simply missing. Only Debit card was visible.Those copy/paste solutions you guys spammed me with in the customer chat and again here as a response to my review ARE NOT WORKING!!It takes a lot of energy trying to explain to your customer support that the flaw lies with the N26 app and not with the customer.But you know what? It does not matter anymore since my problem has already been resolved after the bug was magically fixed in the N26 app (for both my Androind and iOS devices). I sincerely hope I never have to use N26 support again..","Hey Marcel,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.We regret to learn that you had this negative experience.We are more than happy to help you resolve any issue you may be experiencing and investigate this matter further for you.

anonymous,"TERRIBLE. Use another banking service!Having deposited the first amount onto my recently open-end N26 account (via a till in a pound shop... since this was the only way to deposit cash in my vicinity, a district in a capital city, Vienna), I knew N26 would charge a percentage for having done so (something a decent bank would not) but I knew this in advance and despite this being an issue, decided I will give this bank a shot. I set up various domestic standing orders to leave this N26 account. however, three weeks after having deposited the money, I woke up to all of it having disappeared from my account. withdrawn at a cash point halfway across the world. ok, fraud unfortunately can happen. so straight away I contacted N26, was told where to find the links to documents I now needed to complete in order to retrieve my stolen funds. for more than a month I did not receive ANY communication back from N26. I contacted the chat assistants three times. one of them particularly incompetent and rude. threatening me with it being just out of courtesy to retrieve my monies. implying I better behave kindly if I wanted the possibility of being refunded the stolen money from N26, despite it being a very evident fraud (due to the geographic of the card use). following were various deductions from my N26 account by N26 for having incurred international bank charges and thereby being overdrawn. but still no peep regarding a resolve. or anyone really to acknowledge and confirm the dealing of my case. and the stopping of the persistent N26 charges for being overdrawn. first I was informed I would hear back after 2x weeks. when two weeks arrived I was told it would be 3. after 3 weeks I was told it would be SIX weeks before anyone would get back to me. finally, after 5 weeks someone contacted me and I finally received my money back. in the meantime I have had to go to the trouble of opening another bank account (with another bank of course), and canceling/setting up all standing orders again so my bills could go out. if you are looking for an ""international' bank card, DO opt for another... N26 use impolite language when speaking with their customers, patronising at times. their banking security precautions definitely appear to be sub-standard.MONZO is a great alternative, I have used them for years, never a problem. but the grief I went through with N26 - definitely NEVER again.","Hey,Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.First of all we regret to learn of your negative experience, we take this type of feedback very seriously and would like the opportunity to discuss this with you further in order to investigate this matter for you.Can you please contact us via our Twitter support @N26_Support, we are very active here and our team is available to assist you right away.

AT,"Trustpilot asks me to ""leave out offensive words"" so I will try my best to do it.Before starting to read this, please take a look at this N26 support page, especially to the first common reason of bank transfer failure: Google ""Failed SEPA Transfers - N26 Support Center"" and open the first link. Is it clear, right? If ""the recipient's name on the transfer order is different from the name on their account (must be their name as written on their ID)"" the bank transfer must fail (I'm using ""must"" because they use it as well and it seems that it's mandatory that the recipient's name must be correct).Now, let's try to do a little experiment together: find a friend/relative of yours which has an N26 account and do a bank transfer to them but instead of using the ""name as written on their ID"", use a casual one (a random string, whatever comes to your mind). Result? The bank transfer is correctly performed.Moreover, they specify the following: ""To get a transfer, you'll only need to provide the sender with your full name (as it's written on the ID you provided for verification) and your IBAN."". So why N26 is accepting bank transfers even if the recipient's name is wrong? Who knows...Here is my story in very few words: I have got scammed (07/07/2020 - 420 euro - not so much but worth investigating). The bank transfer has been done from an N26 account to an N26 account.I naively based EVERYTHING on the fact that the recipient's name must be right and if a bank allows to create a bank account with a fake ID, well, they should be held accountable for that. My fault, will use PayPal from now on.The first thing I did was to report the fraud to German Police. Once completed, I started to write to N26 support to get this sorted out (first message on 20/07/2020). In the very first reply they stated that they ""will get in touch with the recipient's bank and try to arrange a transaction reversal"": I then kindly replied that the recipient's bank was N26 itself and asked for a better estimation. Then silence mixed to very generic ""we will get back to you when we know more"" replies came in.Yesterday (16/11/2020), after more than one month of complete silence, I decided to open a chat instead of replying to the message thread: a support agent opened the discussion very kindly, they suggested me to check my spam email (...) and then the magic happened: ""I see your concerns and I understand your frustration. I will contact the relevant department. Thank you. If you have no further questions I will have to close this chat."". Then I asked if they have an ETA and they told ""I have no more to add to this."".So, since you are so proud of your simplicity and transparency, could you please tell me what's going on here? Is it really taking more than five months to investigate on a case where the recipient's bank is you?This is not how you should treat customers for serious issues - we're all good to support customers when they're just fine.","Hi Alessandro,We regret to learn that this has happened to you.If you action a SEPA transfer to another bank account, it will be carried out providing the recipient's account is open and functional. A common reason for failed SEPA transfers, as listed in our Support Center article, is due to the fact the name differs. The reason we recommend matching the name on the transfer to the name on the account, is due to the fact we carry out routine checks on user transactions. If the transfer is deemed unusual or is high, we may reach out to the recipient to ask for proof of the origin of the transfer. It can prove considerable more difficult to retrieve funds that are sent via a SEPA transfer than it is for a card transaction. For a bank transfer to be carried out via N26, you must give your consent twice - the consent to transfer the funds that is prompted in the N26 app, as well as entering your secure PIN to confirm the transfer. For this reason, we always advise only transferring money to accounts of people that you know personally. We hope that this issue can be resolved for you ASAP.Best Regards,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",2020-11-17,2020-11-17,1.0,0,2020,Positive

Kristy,"I have to admit that until now everything is going very well (even though I was skeptical at the beginning). I admire online support in English where they are fast and super helpful to me (for now). It is great when you are in another country and still lack native language experience but need a bank card for your needs (+simple card is free!).The only weakness I found is a verification process, that was quite difficult (I had to call them few times due to internet problems my/their way), is which is understandable since it is fully online. Due to that I hope you guys will have a support office like a real bank in the closest future. Good luck, cheers!",Pending,2020-11-10,2020-11-10,4.0,0,2020,Positive

Lenora,"The look of the debit card is the only pro about this company.  Their first con is that they do not have mobile check cashing.  They have no way for you to get money onto the card other than through direct deposit.  This is a big problem.Their second issue is their lacking compatibility with so many other banks and early payday apps like Earnin.  You cannot find them anywhere.  While they use Plaid for incoming external bank transfers, you are not able to use Plaid to transfer money out.  With that said, their entire goal is to keep your money in the account, and make it nearly impossible to transfer it elsewhere.  No American bank does this. But this isn't an American bank, its German.  Which is another reason to be weary.  How they are lawfully able to operate here is beyond me.And lastly, their card rarely works in the real world.  I have had so many issues paying at stores with reader and chip errors galore.  I just don't know about this account anymore.

Rico William,"I've been using N26 since last year of August 2019. No problem with any direct deposits from employers, no problems with debit card transactions, and no problem with cash app or paypal use. Everything was fine until this evening when I received an email stating N26 declared my incoming Unemployment Insurance deposit ""fraudulent"" and sent back the funds to the ""original sender"" which is the state of Massachusetts UI, a government agency. I contacted them via phone and they told me they couldn't explain why this had been determined but they were confident in telling me that they wouldn't accept any deposit from this ""original sender"" at all. This was honestly the nail in the coffin and the end of my use with N26 after a 10/10 user experience with this bank in the short time I've had them. I've had 5 figure balances and transactions go in and out with no problem while being employed but when I actually need money now, they go ahead and deny my Unemployment Income during unprecedented COVID times. How could a company be so cruel and inhumane? What are the odds an institution declines a deposit from a verified and true GOVERNMENT agency but accepts payroll deposits from shady employers who barely have a website running? What kind of sadistic act is this N26? This has definitely pushed me towards cryptocurrency even harder, because not only do traditional banks lack any empathy whatsoever, but so do up and coming ""challenger"" banks. All are corrupt if you ask me. Stay away from all banks, guys.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Edwin,"Awful, awful, awful....I opened an account, and the debit card arrived. Looked cool.  I searched in their app where I could use an ATM, and went to the closest one to my home.  I tried using it three times and COULD NOT get money out.  Texted customer support, and they said ""oh you tried to take too much money out.""  Really?  I was taking out $40.  Give me a break.  So then I just had it, as I was already suspicious you could not transfer money out via ACH.  They take your money, but tough to get it out.  I asked to cancel the account.  ""Oh, it takes ten days."" Really?  Walk into BofA, HSBC, Wells Fargo and when you walk out, the account is closed. Well, here we are over a month, and they still HAVE NOT closed the account.  I think this is a scam.  I got my money out via my company, as I just charged on the debit card what was in my account, but this is NOT the way to do business.  OVER A MONTH...and still the account lives.  I would suggest SIMPLE, REVOLUT, GREEN DOT....but NOT N26.  BEWARE.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Brieuc Jeunhomme,"Bureaucratic signup experience, and then customer support wastes my time with lies.I tried to signup for a n26 account.  After filling all the forms and following all the steps, I received an email saying that my identity verification failed, with 0 details about why.  I asked details, the customer support claimed it was because my selfie was fluffy.  So I did the whole thing again.  Same result.Since the app requires geolocalisation at the end of the procedure, I asked customer support if by any chance the problem was that I was in Switzerland when I tried to signup while my normal residence is in Ireland.  Turned out that *this* was the problem, it had nothing to do with fluffy pictures.  Since I will be in Switzerland for a long time and thereâs no way for me to change the country in the application, I asked them to cancel my application, to restart from scratch.  They said they did, but yet now, one day later, I still canât start a new application, the site refuses it.This geolocation is a bureaucratic relique from another century.  Some other mobile banks don't require it (Dukas copy for ex).  And customer support that lies, really?  What kind of trust in a financial institution does that inspire?","Hey!Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.First of all, sorry to hear you have had a negative experience, we would like to help rectify this for you.

Matt B,"The worst bank. I had to re order a lost card and waited over two weeks. They still havenât sent the card. I called customer service and they claim they NEVER sent my card off because there was a âtypoâ in the address column. Not one f**kn employee from the company or seo tool they have was able to notify and let me know of this mistake so I could fix it. No email no nothing. Had I not called I would have been waiting longer for nothing because they donât give a s**t and make you go THROUGH THE MOST THE MOST THE MOST for them to just still say f*** you anyway.

Burak,"I have decided to open a bank account but the verification via phone has just wasted my 2 hours. You wait for 20-30 minutes until you connect and receive commands, but if you do not respond immediately they just terminate the connection.

Mike,"Be aware that N26 do NOT offer instant bank to bank transfers and bank transfers cannot be cancelled once issued.Everything seemed very quick and easy up until the point when I put my faith in N26 and they let me down when I needed them most when trying to buy a second hand car. Having issued the transfer they told me it would take 1-2 days for the transfer to complete, leaving me in an impossible situation as I was trying to complete the transaction in person with the vendor. And they donât have the power to cancel a bank to bank transfer once issued.In the end I had to grovel back to my high street bank and transfer the same amount again, but this time via their instant transfer service. Now I have the problem of trying to recuperate the money thatâs still in transit from N26 to the vendor ...All in all, a very scary experience.

Daniela MÃ¡rceles,"Beware of this bank.Iâve been a customer for 3 years. My first two years I had an incredible experience in all aspects. I didnât have to pay fees to withdraw from ATMs, not even in different countries. Customer service was quick and always helpful. But everything has changed, and not for the good. Iâve been having issues with them this past year. Nothing major, but customer service isnât what it used to be. Then something shocking happened: they closed my account with no previous warning. Apparently I violated their terms, but they wonât specify what it is that I did wrong. They were quick to answer on social media, but no one gives me clear answers. The representative on the live chat refuses to give me more information, and my emails have gone completely unanswered. If you check their instagram page, they have received many comments with a similar story to mine, and some people havenât even been able to get the funds that they had in their account back. I would recommend that new customers stay away from this bank because they are just not safe.EDIT about the answer: Wow, I just got yet another unhelpful answer.

Taha,"Discriminatory bank. I live in Germany and I have a 5-years rÃ©sidence card still valid for two more years . They simply refused my membership because the representatives of customer service , dared, to judge the residence card is not valid. I donât know, they think they are the immigration agents or what ? Pretending they know what are the types of the residence cards issued by the German authorities .  One of them was saying it has to be a card shaped and the second one said, this is the rule, no credit card shaped card , no account at N26. This is insane, it really shows how amateur and how incompetent are some of the agents.  So, I got declined for the stupidity of whoever. My residence card is not in a shape of credit card, Talk to the immigration service why I was given another type of residence card  shape. Indirectly they made me feel I am faking my documents but didnât say it: they keep advancing this is not valid, this is not accepted . Then what ? You want me to bring a  card meeting your standards or what ?I donât have  the authority  to do it, then bye bye. I tried and I realized how dumb such a bank is. Itâs non-sense what you advance . Your employees definitely lack of training and should rather spend an internship at the immigration service or research Ã  bit about the cards. For being ignorant and pretend knowing, I prefer to escape. Never again with this poor bank. Such a shameEDIT: about the answer: Amazing! Gag me. I just got another stupid response.

EDUARDO A.,"I opened an account with  N26 a few years ago and it used to work well until then.I even referred some friends and family to open an account because the bank worked very well.Well, based on the regular and positive experience I had previously, for some guarantees and for being a person who travels a lot, I chose to upgrade to a version that the N26 offers by paying a monthly fee of 9.90 euros per month (Business You) and supposedly it would have Allianz insurance coverage and several other coverages and other services. For me this would be very interesting, if it worked properly, but unfortunately it doesn't work at all!Going straight to the point and being very objective, I paid this monthly fee assiduously for practically a year and a half, while I didn't need any sort of coverage or any kind of services offered by the N26, believe it or not, at the moment when I needed it most, in the middle of the pandemic situation (covid 19) there was no coverage at all. I tried to contact the Allianz insurance from N26 that I was supposed to  be covered, and I had no positive return/results. It Was denied actually. I then tried to contest/dispute the charges with the support of the N26 team, it was also denied and I noticed that the N26 support team made no effort to help me with that completely unpleasant situation.To sum it all up, I paid for 1 year and a half and I had no support AT ALL, I never took any advantage, I never used any service and no money was returned to me and never will be refunded. The clarifications that the N26 provided me were completely vague and frivolous.Instead of overriding errors and omissions, the N26 support team always always and relentlessly trying to find a bunch of excuses or trying to transfer responsibility to third parties. I could not expect absolutely nothing different than that bad professional attitude. I could not expect nothing different than that sort of people and companies completely without character!I do not recommend for anyone to become a member!Never more and no further!","Hi Eduardo,We're sorry to learn that you had some issues when filing a claim with Allianz.We are unfortunately unable to advise or assist in matters pertaining to insurance, as we are not the direct insurance provider.

Kayla Urdzik,"I signed up for an N26 account so that my husband could transfer me money to pay bills online.  More specifically, my car payment which requires us to call the bank and both give consent to charge his account for my car.  Due to the pandemic we haven't had the time to go to a bank and open a joint account, I thought this would be easier.  The problem is...like most people....my car payment is well into the $300s, but you can only transfer up to $150 at a time.  Additionally, I can't even transfer money because they require your name to be on the account or card you are transferring from...if I had a debit card with my name on it, why would I need a second debit card to transfer my money to? In all honesty, this bank works for one situation alone.  You have no one you want to transfer money to EVER, and you have a job that pays you via direct deposit.

Thomas S.,"I wanted to help my 18-year-old daughter open her first bank account, a French N26 account (she lives in France) while she visited me in Germany, and I contacted N26 chat support about whether the card could be posted to Germany in such a case.They said her phone would connect to the T&Cs corresponding to the device's location settings (whatever that is) and that she should only do it while physically in France â which is not very helpful and violates the principle of free movement in the EU.Then they implied that I was trying to manipulate their system and referred to fraud protection laws and furthermore said that their rules banned me from helping her.I felt insulted, as I was only trying to ensure she was signed up to the country in which she is resident, and why on earth should a parent be banned from helping  a child sign up to their first bank account? The bank replied below, ""It is also important that the user signs up for their bank account themselves, and passes verification by themselves,"" which is obvious. I never suggested anything else during the chat, but claiming that I am banned from helping her at all with her first bank account is outrageous.Their attitude was overzealous and paranoid, as if living in one country in the EU and temporarily being in another were a crime. Isnât it strange that the more digital services we get, the more such services aim to lock us into a digital prison in one single member state of the EU? Where is the freedom of movement for consumers? It seems only to be for corporations.Physically being present in a country in no way certifies that one lives there anyway. Making such a geolocation check verifies nothing else than the account holder's momentary presence at a given location, not their legal residence. The bank is entitled to this policy, but there is no law against living in one country and opening an account in another, there is no legal requirement for a geolocation check to open a bank account, and there was no suggestion during the chat that she intended to do that anyway. The bank itself benefits from the free movement of financial services and offers services in several member states and then suggests manipulation and fraud if a potential client has the nerve to make use of the same freedom of movement and demands the user be kept in a straitjacket in relation to their physical location â pure hypocrisy. So should consumers consider N26 fraudsters and manipulators because they operate in more than one member state? One rule for the corporations and another for the peasants.Iâm aware of the legal requirements to âknow your customerâ, but again, a momentary geolocation check doesnât verify anything of importance. To do things online and benefit from the internet with this bank, the user has to be physically present a particular place, just as 100 years ago at a high-street bank, which is absurd. One step forward and one step back. The peasants must be kept in their place.When someone has close family in more than one member state and thus needs to spend regular periods in both members states, it does not seem reasonable to expect that an individual temporarily present in that other member state should be partially administratively paralysed, as N26 insists on in the case of opening an account. But for most corporations, the world is amazingly simple when it comes to their perception of consumers: Germans live in Germany and speak German and nobody else lives there and if anyone does anything else, they must be potential fraudsters. This one chat convinced us that this is a hostile and aggressive bank best avoided. At least we should thank them for the early warning. I thank the bank for the suggestion to take this further, but they managed to lose all my trust during one initial chat session, so I have no wish to have anything further to do with N26, also not for my own separate professional activities.","Hi Thomas,We'd like to apologise for any miscommunication or hostility that may have come across whilst your daughter was trying to sign up for an account.We believe there was a misunderstanding here. The geolocation of the mobile device must be enabled to verify your N26 account, and this is an unavoidable step. If in Germany, the geolocation of the device would indicate this to our app, and thus assign the user a German N26 account, with German T&Cs. It's not possible to obtain an account with French T&Cs whilst in Germany - the user has to physically be in France to do this. It is of course possible to move between locations such as Germany and France and still use your N26 account, but if your daughter wanted an account with French T&Cs, she would need to open the account whilst physically in France. Otherwise, a German account would be assigned by default, as she is within Germany. It is possible to use a German N26 account in France, and vice versa.It is also important that the user signs up for their bank account themselves, and passes verification by themselves. If there is any indication of outside interference whilst going through photo or video verification, this can be flagged by our verification system as a potential security risk.

Miguel Angel Alba Acosta,"One transfer was sent two times from my account due to a bug in the app (the confirmation of payment was two times in the screen), the solution they proposed was ""send an email to the receptor to ask for the money back, if not we could make a payment study with an additional charge of 15â¬"", pretty disappointing solving issues, also you cannot print extracts or transferences in other languages different from the default. In the case of transactions, they do not have any type of ID or way to differentiate them if one was done twice. The card is awful and weak, sometimes it does not work properly in stores.

J. Jeffers,"This situation would be laughable if not for the fact that I have a terminally ill son whom I am the sole provider for and with covid 19 finances are tight. So I am a member of a credit union and have been for some 10 years. I opened this N26 account when they first expanded to the United States. I sell on posh, offer up etc etc and I buy a lot of goods from China directly. So I keep my living checking account and my online/virtual accounts separate. Recently after receiving my school refund my Apple phone was stolen and on it in the wallet case was both my bank cards. So I had about 6 charges that were made on my credit union card and 2 made on my N26 card. So naturally I file a dispute with both the credit union and N26. So a little time goes by and I receive a letter from my credit union saying in accordance with regulation E they have provisionally credited my account. (Bare in mind that all 6 charges disputed with unify have since been found fraudulent and have been refunded permanently as their final decision) anyway when I receive the letter I contacted them and asked if that apply to other banks in general or just credit unions because I also had a dispute within n26  they assured me it Applies to all banks and urged me to message them and find out what the reasoning for not provisionally crediting my account was. So on their advice I did so. Instead of issuing a provisional credit they instead froze my account. Which made no difference because there were zero dollars in there. They informed me any funds that attempted to go in would be rejected. Imagine my surprise when they accepted  $52 deposited from Poshmark for a sale and $102 from wayfair. So now in total they have $160 of my money and refuse to transfere it to my credit union or to my ex wifeâs N26 account. Itâs been 3 weeks and i msg them every day and every day they hang up on me and provide me with no information. Like if my account is frozen and I cannot withdrawal money and you say will not accept any into it then do, is that not tantamount to theft? I have screenshots of every conversation Iâve had with them and am at my wits end. To the point Iâm tempted to say screw the dispute because I need my $160 but the one charge is from an out of the us gambling set up(I donât gamble my sons meds cost way to much and the new steroid is not yet made in generic so itâs out of pocket every month) they should have never processed a $500 ach to a bookie anyway what are they thinking. Iâve never spent over $150 on anything. So red flags should have shot up when $500 was ach debited by Skillz Sports. Iâm at a loss and Iâm in dire need of my money that they stole by accepting. After telling me they would refuse. Iâm tempted to allow my school refund to go in there in 11 days and then contact my federal appointed loan handler and tell them Iâm being refused my refund by the bank it was deposited in.... I just need my money. I have a sick child who cannot walk.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

However,  their identity partner only accepts residence permits in an ID card format (!), even though the document is/ has exactly the same legal validity. I  had to contact their customer support several times and file a complaint, but still nothing, my account remains unduly locked and I only get procrastinating answers, apart from the messages that they send internally via their system and I cannot read because (REMEMBER ?) my access is locked.

Ebony Evans,I used N26 as a travel card then main account after they proved themselves as a decent bank with good international fees and okay app. Â£100k+ in over a year.  They closed my (all) UK (residents) accounts due to Brexit licensing issues. I then had an accidental refund from an airline due to COVID-19. I was promised it would reach my nominates UK acct within 10 days. Most likely sooner. Two months later and ignored emails from âMarkâ numerous excuses about theyâre using a new company / having issues / Iâm in the refund queue. I believe they may go into administration   I will be reporting them to action Fraud once my questions have been answered (several emails asking who the 3rd party company they are alledgely using. No reply). This is a shame as I would have continued using them when I move abroad.,"Hey Ebony, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Alex F,"I have been using N26 for nearly a year, where like clockwork, I get my direct deposit twice a month, I withdraw cash when needed, occasionally I have money transferred to my card from CashApp/Venmo and the like, pay my bills, make purchases at the Supermarket, Dunkin' Donuts, and a handful of other places. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Suddenly today my account is temporarily suspended due to ""suspicious activity"" -- ??? As a customer for nearly a year with consistent deposit and spending habits, what on earth could possibly be suspicious? I now have no access to my funds, so in effect my bank is telling me that I am not allowed to eat, to do laundry, to commute to and from work, or basically do any of the normal functions to live. How can this be legal? This is an absolutely insane position to put someone in, and there is zero communication. I had to find out when trying to use my card? I am stonewalled by support via phone & chat. I tried to tweet @ and send a DM to N26US through Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. If you are considering using N26, only do so if you are okay with a bank that has no qualms with creating a disruption in your life and not give you any useful information whatsoever. For a fintech bank that I have loved using for nearly a year, I could not be more disappointed, aggravated, and in all honesty forced into a very difficult financial situation.","Hey, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

I finally convinced her to open an account and today she had identity verification. The agent was speaking fast and she said she understand german but not so fast, and she asked him to please speak more slowly. He said that he will not speak slow and if she doesn't understand what he is saying she can't open an account and then hung up. She has b1 level and has no problem to to everyday stuff in german; to see a doctor or to have a job interview. When she first arrived to Germany she didn't speak 2 words of german but she managed to open an account in Post bank. Perfect german is not on the list of requirements and I have no idea why it's been reinforced. Why this makes me so sad is because that agent crushed her confidence in a few seconds. And also her willingness to try something new. You have to understand there's a big age gap and she is not tech savvy. I had to write down her phone number and email, this is how older generation funktion. I also have an account with Revolut and I helped her to open an account in 5 Minutes.

They just do not know what they're doing!Since N26 is a german bank, I thought they have an idea of what a valid residence permit look like. It can be in card form or the paper form that you stick in your Passport. I have a paper residence permit. IDnow agent said she can't accept mine because it only has 1 page, she said a valid one should have 2 pages. Which is stupid. And then she just hung up on me. How charming.I then went to chat agent, first one said it's because they only accept the card version. And I asked him to get me a German agent.The German guy asked if my visa permanent. I said no, it's valid for 3 years. And he said that's why, they only accept permanent residence. Which is bull, because many of my friends use N26 and they have even shorter permit.They seriously have to educate themselves.And I tried one more time, I went to chat, and again the agent said only card visa is valid. I asked him, where does it say that? He can't answer me.then I try the video call again, and the agent said my residence permit is not on their ""database"" so she needs another form of ID and she asked for a student visa. I'm not a student anymore and I have working visa now. And when I said that, she hung up on me abruptly. Charming.That's it for me then. I asked a chat agent to erase my data and I would never gonna suggest anyone to use N26.

It was sooo easy, zero stress experience!I also have Revolut account, when I opened it, it was no stress, everything went quick and smooth.So N26, do you realise how terrible you are?","Hi Eva,We're sorry to learn of the issues you had when verifying, and for any misinformation you received.Currently, our verification provider can only accept the two-page version of the residence permit to open your N26 account, so it is not possible to verify with the one-page version at this moment in time.Best Regards,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",2020-08-02,2020-08-02,Not Rated,0,2020,Negative

Agnes Fiamma Papone,"Very intuitive and easy to use banking app. Messaging could be easier, because it feels like you have to know where to find the backdoor to send and receive or attach files. Attaching file does not work smoothly which is very frustrating when trying to report fraudulent card charges following an already unpleasant incident of theft. I would suggest making the fraud/dispute process fully online rather than having the printing and scanning process. There must be a way to digitise the signature process since other (less technologically inclined) banks can do it.

This point i donnot understand.But it is rarely happens to find in a shopping center/ restaurant/cafe without creditcard suitable devices...It would be nice to use the card as a Creditcard and at the same time as a Debitcard everywhere (i mean even old diveces). I havent tried it in abroad yet,but hopefully it works also in other countries.Since a year i have an account in N26 i did not have any other or big problems. Ä°t is fast and easy.

Paul R-D,"Unfortunately although the account is easy to set up and use, I can't give it any more than a 1 star rating.  I purposely set up the account to be able to utilise direct debits and fast transfers free of charge, both of which were advertised on their website as a benefit.  Once the account was set up, it was clear that both of these claims were incorrect.  After setting up a number of direct debits with a number of different merchants in Italy, all failed to be set up correctly until N26 finally admitted after many calls that it was not possible at this time to set up direct debits in Italy.  I had a similar experience when trying to instigate an instant or fast transfer for a purchase, again as advertised on their website - when it came to it, the bonifico / transfer took a day and a half to come through to the receiving company and when I asked, they couldn't even give me a formal note or evidence of the transaction beforehand.  So all in all, if you want very basic functionality, then the account is fine.  But they clearly make a lot of promises before you open the account which they can't actually follow up on.  When I raised these concerns as a complaint via their support service, the very helpful advice provided was on how to close my account it was no longer needed - great customer service.......","Hey Paul,Thank you for getting in touch!First of all, sorry to hear you have had a negative experience, we would like to help rectify this for you. We support SEPA transfers, a direct debit failure happens when the merchant in particular relies exclusively on the SEDA channel (and not SEPA) to which N26 is not currently registered. We are currently looking into this but have no information to share at this time. We will remain transparent and update our customer's accordingly should any new features become available.All domestic and international incoming SEPA transfers are instant if they come from a bank that supports instant transfers and the sender selects this option. In cases where the sending bank doesnât offer instant transfers or the sender doesnât choose this option, the transfer will be completed within one banking day. However, due to the opening times of the participating banks, one banking day may stretch to two working days. Outgoing SEPA transfers are completed within one banking day. You are able to send money instantly between N26 accounts with Moneybeam.If you would like to discuss this further we would be happy to help.

Worse however, it then executed two identical transfers (same amount and recipient). So I turn to the support. Support says, though luck, I need to recoup the money myself. I ask what's that nonsense? Clearly it was you app's unsolicited behaviour that caused the issue. Support says, we haven't heard of the problem yet, so basically I am lying or stupid or whatever...

Aic,"SCAM ALERT!!! ~ NIGHTMARE ~I mentioned to them that I would post an unfavorable review due to their lack of professionalism.** To start with, N26 promotes to be offering a prime world-class card service, and it's not even close. A prime world-class bank company should offer a 24 hours of customer service, for their nowadays WORLD-TRAVELER customers, shouldn't they? Not to mention that we talk about financial services for travelers. Well, not in this case, in spite of the monthly fee charges, N26 people will only work during German office hours (God knows what those hours are!) and only are to be contacted by email or by social platform chats, such as LinkedIn or this one!. There's no phone number where to call. The chat room of their app is never answered. Email replays take weeks or sometimes even months. That's enough to know of someone in whom you trust your money, or financial assistance when traveling abroad.** N26 people will let you open an account and rush-deliver your selected brand-new card, EVEN WHEN they aware that you intend to use it for services THAT THEY DON'T OFFER.** N26 won't tell you crystal clear that they don't offer regular bank card services, even though they claim to offer a prime world-class card service. So, you'll only know after signing a contract.** N26 won't tell you crystal clear that they only offer insurance services FOR TRAVELING purposes, and ONLY for selected countries in the world. Or they have it written in a super small letter and hard to decipher it, even though it is a fundamental clause of their policy.** After you open an account with N26, you WON'T BE ALLOWED to close it at need (in my case, due to it'll be unuseful to me because I travel for work). So, you'll be forced to pay the maintenance fee for an entire year, until the contract year is due. Be sure that world-class financial services will let you close your account at any given time with no additional fees. Because they don't live up on that. N26 does. **In this case, N26 won't either allow you to downgrade to the free membership card (transparent) once you signed for a higher membership. Be sure that world-class black card services have NO problem accommodating your membership to your needs. ** Be sure that N26 people will give you a terribly hard time closing your account with uncountable justifications, after the year contract is due, while they'll keep deducting the monthly maintenance fee. N26 people won't answer your emails and/or pretend that they'are unaware of your correspondence when they do answer. Although, be prepared to explain many times in different ways the same thing in many emails because it apparently always replies to you a different signing person.** Finally, after many months of negotiations where you'll be asked to send additional documentation, you'll get notified by email about the closure of your account. In a world-class financial service, this simple fact would mean the end and final say of membership, but it will not mean the same for the N26 people. It means that you'll now receive further uncomfortable correspondence with inaccurate information about the status of your account and that of course, you now own them some money because either such account never REALLY close, or they're not aware that they formally closed it before.This means, that even though your account was formally closed, they'll still contact you with inaccurate information, for years later.*** So why contracting any service with N26? Please research more if you think doing it.","Hey,Thanks for taking the time to leave your review.

Shirin Assa,"Extremely easy app to work with. It is so convenient to manage your finances with N26. No bank in Germany offers such a easy and simple online banking and more importantly, all data is available in English and customer service is really fluent in English and they actually offer HELPFUL advise not bunch of excuses and useless explanations. I recommend it to everyone, especially to oversees students like myself who are subjected to so many scutiny and racist behaviours of other banks in opening a bank account!

TonY YnoT,My card chip has issues at a lot of stores but my main issue is that my direct deposit was returned by N26 to my employer without any notice or reason. My card was also locked without my knowledge and I did not receive any emails concerning either situation.

Nick,"Excellent Bank and app. The perfect mobile bank, does everything it promises in the ads. My only gripe, and the reason Iâm taking away one star, concerns the IBAN. Customers opening new accounts in Italy will now get Italian IBANs while those of us who opened accounts earlier this year and before remain saddled with German IBANs and all difficulties having a foreign IBAN in Italy entails. N26 had promised weâd have the option to change to an Italian IBAN if we wished but there have been no updates or timelines for when/if that would happen. That aside, no complaints whatsoever.

It took a long time to get it all sorted out. I ended up having to reinstall the app even thought I had just installed it.Now about two weeks later, I could not log on to the mobile app. Again I contacted customer service and after some difficulties getting the agent correctly to understand my problem, I was advised to reinstall the mobile app again.I don't have time to waste solving technical problems every two weeks.

Lara Hanson,"If there was a way to leave ZERO stars, I would! They have all kinds of ways for you to put money into your N26 account, but precious few to get your money back out again. Don't put your money here unless you can be without it for an unspecified amount of time. Seriously!For some reason (and no one can tell me why), they are doing a security review which has locked down my account for 4+ business days so far. No one will tell me why, and no one will tell me how long this will take. They just say it'll be over when it's over. DON'T USE THIS BANK!It has now been a full 7 days and I still have no access to the money in my account. When I ask for an ETA for the review to be done, they say they don't know. When I ask how long these reviews usually take on average, they don't know. When I ask to speak to a superior, they cannot do that. When I ask how to close my account and get my money back, they cannot do that until the review is over. BOTTOM LINE: THEY KEEP YOUR MONEY AS LONG AS THEY WANT, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!!!!","Hi Lara,We apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused you.

In another review on Google Play, the support team simply replied with a link to an unhelpful documentation page.I doubt the support even bothered to read the review.There is no way to reach them to get an explanation.Edit after N26s reply:Basically what you're saying that when I was registered and provided my name, you have rejected my account based on my last name. According to your documentation, I'm a resident of a country that you allow to have an account. What I'm saying is that your application is bad, it didn't allow me to add any documentation and rejected me by my name","Hi Nastia,As a regulated mobile bank, we are obliged to securely verify the identity of all potential customers. It is necessary to hold one of our currently supported documents to verify your account, which can be viewed through the link you have mentioned: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/verifying-identity/how-to-prove-my-identityIf you cannot see the document corresponding to the nationality you have signed up with on that list, then it would mean we are unable to verify your account at this moment in time, however we are always working hard to add new supported documents to this list, so we hope to be able to onboard you in future.If you do have a document mentioned on our list, you can open a live chat using the link attached to this message.

To have a specific look into your case, we would need you to contact us so we can identify your account.

If you have any concern about a transfer you made to your N26 account, you would need to contact the sending bank for further information. In the case we were the sending institution, we would be able to advise further, but we cannot do so as the recipient.Please note that we only accept incoming SEPA transfers in Euro. We accept SEPA instant for incoming transfers, but only if the sending bank also supports this. If SEPA instant is not used, then the transfer will take 1 banking day, which can stretch to 2 days, depending on when the transfer is made. The weekend is excluded in this, so a transfer made on Friday but not via SEPA instant would arrive on Monday.Best Regards,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",2020-06-27,2020-06-27,2.0,0,2020,Negative

kiriakos kardamis,"I changed to N26 after I started working as a Seafarer.For me N26 provided a bunch of solutions for my work. As I am traveling the world trough my job its  impossible to not have online banking, thanks to N26 I am able to check my account in real time, on the Sea, in Croatia, Madagascar, where ever I am.Actually I have the N26 BusinessYou Membership, which allows me to withdraw money all around world, without paying any fees, mostly, I think some banks like on madascar still took 2euro fees, wich is not that horrible at all. Every transaction is visible in my account, so if I withdraw money on the Seychels from an ATM, I will get the Seychelles Currency and they will have it in my account transferred to my Account Currency so that I can allways check the exchange Rate and see hoch much Euros this 5000 SeychellesRupies were(as example).Also was it not a Problem to deliver my new CreditCard directly to my Vessel, thanks to the App I can change my Adress at any Time. In case I'm losing my card I can Lock it directly trough the App and still Pay trough my Mobile Wallet until the new one arrives. Even after a unauthorized transaction trough a online site, I gave them my information so it was my mistake, I found out that there could be some more transactions trough the organization. So I had to block my Account. After 3mins with the support Chat I had it fixed, N26 blocked my account for safety of my Money and send me a new CreditCard wich will arrive in few days.Even as I Told the support before blocking my account I have to withdraw money for my groceries he told that would be total OK, I should just hurry up, come back to chat after withdrawal and then he will continue the process. The support is very dedicated in Customers Service, allways friendly and helpful - not to mention that they exactly now what they do. From checking my Personal information to avoid someone wrong cheating with them, to anything inside the app or international questions.Last but not Least - Cash26Cash26 allows me to withdraw money from shops like Rossman, DM Drogerie, or even at gas stations like OMV for free. So I don't allways have to run for an ATM, wich could be a long way, instead the N26APP will show me all possible ATMs and Cash26 providing Shops, and so I can decide where to go to withdraw my money.Little thing here, Cash26 should work better on communicating this function to the Shops Workers, because sometimes they looked at me like I would try something illegal so if the Cashier don't knows Cash26 and hears it for the first time he will call the manager to take care of that process, that's totally ok they are just keeping themselfs safe from any scam. So I can recommend N26 to everyone, Seafarers, traveller, even if you are not leaving your country that much, the possibilities and the control that I have on my money trough N26 are insane.Thanks for reading, hopefully I can help someone with my review here is my N26 promotional code if i helped you in choosing the right Financial Institute. kiriakok2011",Pending,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,5.0,0,2020,Positive

Evelina Sereikaite,"Very disappointed Lithuanian nationals are being discriminated against. During online bank account setup N26 took my full name, address, phone number, nationality, got me to install the app only to block me from verifying my identity. Malawi! is on the list of nationalities that can open N26 accounts, but not Lithuania or Latvia. I wish do delete the account and the sensitive data I have provided N26. What a waste of time.","Hey Evelina, Thank you for your interest in holding an N26 account. As a fully licensed bank we follow strict guidelines from the regulator for remote account openings.

Tracie Bethea,"I had no problems with N26 until recently. I paid my credit card bill with this card as a debit payment and money was taken out of my account immediately. The next week I got my direct deposit and my money is now gone because they are saying the credit card company did not take the money out until 4 days later. I explained to them that money was not available to me it was already on hold so it was not available to me to spend, but they said I did and I did not because it was not available at all. One rep told me that the credit card company had to release an authorization because they had both a hold and have collected the money. I got my credit card company on the line to speak with n26 via three way, because they(credit card co) said they dont work like that and had them talk to n26 then the story changed and I used the money because the bank left it in my available balance which is not true because you clearly see it was deducted twice from my account and the supervisor I spoke to named James told me to figure it out by doing the math, but could not go over anything in my account to prove what he was saying is true. My credit card company still on the line was also confused but his lack of knowledge. I then told James I wanted this escalated he said ok but could not give me a time frame on how long it would take for someone to contact me or give me any reference number for the call or anything. His response was I don't work in that department, Really! This banks customer service is not knowledgeable, has no clue on whats going on, and to top it off my money is missing and no one can explain where it is. Never had these issues with my traditional bank. I Do not recommend this bank to anyone if small questions stump them I can't imagine if I had a huge issue. I now have to take other measures to try to get my money from a bank that has no concern or regard for hard times or people.","Hey Tracie,Thanks for taking the time to explain this to us, we're sorry to hear this.

Rob,"N26 started a partnership with booking.com and it all consists in booking a staying with booking.com using a link provided by N26 through their website and based on that, a percentage of the spent amount would be reimbursed as cachback in my account. At some point I got a message showing the amount I was to receive back. Well, had my staying at the hotel, paid with my card as requested in order to eligible to get the cash back, and a few days after coming back home I contacted N26 to ask about the money, well they said I had to wait 64 DAYS to get the money I was due FIRST TIME I WAS HEARING ABOUT THAT, I was taken aback of course because this wasnât clear on their prospection but well, I decided to wait.70 days later.....nothing yet then I started to get in touch with the bank and was forced to go back and forth between booking.com and N26 customer service team for at least one month, even though at that point I had all the screenshots and proves to show them Iâm eligible to get my money back. Today nearly 4 months after my staying I received one email from N26 with their âfinal positionâ on this matter saying that they would no longer handle this matter and I should contact booking.com and THEY WOULD NOT REPLY TO MY EMAILS.Swear to god, still now I donât now how to react to this, what kind of bank does that to its customers? Seriously, what kind of serious and trustworthy institution does that? Showing 0 respect for clients.Do yourself a favor and never bank or engage in any business with N26, you will be saving yourself a hella headache","Hi Rob,We're sorry that you had such an issue in regards to our recent partnership with Booking.We can assure you that Booking.com are aware of this issue and are in the process of fixing it.

I have money in my account right now and i can't get access to it cause they said they cannot unsuspend my card even in a dire of emergencies and that is bad business to me and my work check will be deposited tomorrow afternoon but i won't be able to get access because my card is frozen and as soon as they are done with whatever im switching to somewhere else i am very dissatisfied with N26,"Hi Wynton,We apologise if this situation has inconvenienced you in any way.

John Bernard,"Excellent online bank. I'm in Spain where there is no independent regulator and consequently the banks are uniformly awful, and I needed to find an alternative after the second Spanish bank in four years started introducing charges for it's no charges account - without telling me! I am retired, just have a pension and no mortgage or insurance needs, just money in, money out.  I was looking for free banking so moving to N26 was a no-brainer, because it gave me that, a Spanish euro account ,and at a stroke removed me from having to deal with the Spanish banking sector. I'm British and the customer service in English is really helpful. The app is very well put together, and easy to use, with lots of nice features like ""spaces"", being able to hide the figures on the screen, as well as getting a changing total as you scroll through transactions -  very clever stuff. What is really impressive though is the customer service. When I first tried to set the account up, I had, without realising it inadvertently gone into the bit for customers with a Spanish ID, so just could not get it to work with my passport. I eventually gave up and abandonded further attempts to set up an account, concluding, (incorrectly), that N26 didn't know what they were doing. Two days later I got a call from N26 customer service, from a guy who initially addressed me in Spanish and then switched to English - I have some Spanish but English is obviously easier. He explained what had gone wrong, fixed the error after asking me if I would like to register as a UK national, and I subsequently set up the account. I can think of few banks that would proactively get in touch in this way. Since then I have had two ocassions to need customer service help where the bot couldn't provide a solution and on both occasions it has been very straightforward getting hold of someone and them dealing with things promptly. There has just been one draw-back so far, and that is that I am unable to pay my Spanish tax bill from my N26 account as N26's licence does not cover this, but presumably will in time.",Pending,2020-06-09,2020-06-09,5.0,0,2020,Positive
Timothy S. Crocker,"Terrible Institution with Terrible Practices. I opened an account at N26 and as long as the transactions were not frequent and of no great amount I had no issue. The first time I performed a ""large"" and I''m talking $500 USD, my account was frozen, I was told to wait 24 hours and it would be accessible - 5 days I was told this same narrative. Noone could tell me why the freeze was placed or even what the exact 24 hour timeframe was. SO, I ended up no using the account for over 2 weeks. The first transaction went through successfully however the account was frozen at the same time. I've spoken with customer service who gives you all "" I don't know"" ""we don't have that information"" and was even disconnected from their chat in the middle of conversation 3 times. Noone can tell me why the account was frozen a second time, how long it will be frozen for, or even what prompted the freeze to take place. Common sense allowed me to decipher this. One thing is for sure, this place is horrible when it comes to customer service. They could care less about restricting any access to your money - which is also a means of survival. There is no mention of frequent account lock outs or freezes however I assure this doesn't with any other bank. I imagine all the people who have favorable experience with this institution keep small amounts of money in their account and probably don't have any heavy transaction traffic. I've looked into the financials of N26 and Axos and all other associated institutions, not really any impressive numbers which makes perfect sense. I have filed a complaint with the FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and forwarded all chat transcripts, transaction statements and a very detailed description of the issue at hand. When a financial institution freezes your account and restricts access to your means of survival (Food, Housing, Utility Payments) for weeks without warning, explaination, or support mechanism for accessing funds to survive - that institution does NOT need to be in operation. This was part of the message I have conveyed to the agencies my complaint has been filed with. In conclusion, there are too many other places to deposit your money that are safer, more dependable, and definately possess a legitimate environment regarding customer service that N26 clearly is against. I just hope I am able to access my money without having to wait weeks if at all.","Hey Timothy, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.

It took two weeks, they was told that the account is closed themselves in two weeks, but it took another five days and I did not receive any of my funds or a response from support. I don't get a reply to my email or support. My account is closed and I haven't received any funds. I plan to write to the regulatory authorities. In addition of my case, I got letter from N26, that they don't returned my funds (2500 EUR) and I should go to write complaint.

It was a matter of a few minutes with a help agent who knew exactly what I needed. Other banks here in Spain require a lengthy visit to the bank, where they don't necessarily know what is needed, and charge up to â¬18 per document. Outstanding service.

My account was 0 and they refunded the first 900 eur...so i immediately transferred my money to my bank to be safe...so my balance was 0 again...then they keep saying they refunded another 900 eur but i never received it in my account.

Wish one day they don't charge over 1%....Still for me right now it's the leading Banking Service App for daily expenses. Unfortunately they only allow 1 account at a time, so if someone is a business owner and want have 2 accounts it gets complicated therefore I use it only as a private person.

Moven Natal,"Spero sia un programmatore N26 a leggere. Questo problema sembra essere troppo tecnico da essere compreso dal loro supporto clienti. Il problema Ã¨ che sia nella app che nel sito web appare un messaggio di errore ""Numero di codice fiscale non valido"" quando invece Ã¨ stato inserito un codice perfettamente valido ma appartenente a quei codici attribuiti dall'Agenzia delle Entrate per risolvere i casi di omocodia. L'Agenzia delle Entrate infatti attribuisce in questi casi (circa 30 mila in Italia) un codice che ha in una o piÃ¹ posizioni una lettera invece di un numero. Quando quindi la app e il sito web vedono una lettera dove pensano (erroneamente) ci debba essere un numero, il messaggio di errore citato su blocca tutto. Ã un problema di programmazione basata su fondamenti errati che vi prego di risolvere, altrimenti Ã¨ impossibile andare avanti con la registrazione visto che il codice fiscale Ã¨ obbligatorio. La risposta piÃ¹ divertente che mi Ã¨ stata data due volte in chat da N26 Ã¨ di andare all'Agenzia delle Entrate e farmi cambiare il codice fiscale! Chiedo scusa per aver dato solo una stella.AGGIORNAMENTO: N26 ha capito e risolto il problema. Lenti, ma vi dico bravi lo stesso.I wish a N26 programmer can read this. This issue seems to be too technical to be understood by their customer service. The problem is, a ""Tax number is not valid"" error message is wrongly returned both on the app and the website if the input is a perfectly valid fiscal code issued by the Italian Tax Office to manage the cases of equality of the fiscal code (omocodia) between different people (about 30 thousands in Italy). These codes have one or more letters in place of numbers, so when the app and the website check for the validity of the code and find a letter instead of a number, the mentioned error message is returned. The Italian Fiscal Code is required when country of residence is Italy, so there is no way to go on with the registration. The most hilarious ""solution"" given online twice by two different reps was to go to the Italian Tax Office and have the code changed! Sorry for the one star.UPDATE: N26 understood and solved the issue. It took too much time, but I give you a thumb up nevertheless.",Pending,2022-02-17,2022-02-17,3.0,0,2022,Positive

Denis,"Trusting of reviews is always difficult because there are always people that try to demonstrate the false with good examples. But guys, I am a Customer from  2016 so an early customer. I come from Deutsche Bank, a very old fashion bank where is super complicated and tricky to do everything. I discover N26 reading on a paper and I tried to trust them. If you try you wonât go back. Cost Are all clear, app experience is amazing and the overall bank experience is exactly how a bank should be today for busy people that works and donât have time to go every time to the Bank branch to make operations. So I strongly recommend N26, and I can tell you that for all the negative review about this bank there are for sure just 2 reasons, 1st they are people from other banks trying to scam this amazing bank, 2nd There are people that actually do not read all the conditions or the advantage or disadvantage Of a specific product For them , in this example of a bank,  and maybe they are people not ready yet for this change or most truthWorthy they have different needs that a traditional bank can satisfy most, I come from italy and we have a serie of Extra operations to make payment That you need to offer, so I understand those customer, but please letâs be honest. They , N26, revolutionise the bank experience and 4 years Later traditional banks are still trying to catch up.

John John,"They are perfect bank - too perfect. I had two cases withÂ  N26. Once almighty greedy ebay.com overcharged me for selling the item (maybe I was wrong with this one, ebay did not changed experience for the better by pointing me to the support on facebook ;-) ) and neither n26.com was great help too. They assigned the agent on my case, many mails went back and forth, they were refusing to help me, they pointed that I should contact, but how can I involve ebay when they ignored me? As far as remember this dude pointed me to contact info at ebay dot com ;-)Â  Great help N26.com!Â  :) This time was similar to the first one. I had unauthorised charge from VietnamCupid (dating site), I was actually their member and I had paid couple of times for their services. Lost interest in them (good portion of woman there are cyber beggars (they are hungry, they lost their phone) and gold diggers) but I left possibility that I could maybe talk with some nice and interesting woman in future. Until ya sneaky Aussie guys hehe, charged me 36 or something EUR for Platinum service which I did not asked for at all. By the way, VietnamCupid keeps your CC info on the file, so if you ever get some unasked charge from them or by some criminal who exploited some 10 years software bug, you know - IT IS YOUR FAULT, not OURS :DÂ  Never mind, back to N26.com. I complained to them about this, they say - sure we will look into your case and contact you. Ok. Week passed, no contact, I chatted with support, this time story changed. First they started that I need to block card (Beware of the cheap banks, they are giving blame on you - reorder card, not any talk how to reverse charge), this time I reacted angry, I said that last week I've heard another story. Oh, yes,Â  I have to fill claimÂ  blabla, had to fill file complain. I lost interest, it is not worth my 36 EUR to have headache with this crappy bank. Had to find another ASAP. So summa summarum, it is up to you if you want very cheap convinent bank (like N26.com) , which is perfect until you have sort of problem. Or you pay say services of the real bank - average 40 EUR every year, who will listen your complains and act accordingly.Â  I think 40 EUR is nothing compared to your nerves in the long run. Imagine if some criminal pulls the file from crappy noName dating site with your CC and pulls 1000 EUR from your card, and what will happen if your bank is N26.com? Think twice :)EDIT:""As both of your cases would have appeared to be merchants you had previously dealt with for authorised transactions, our chargeback team would request that you try your best to make contact with the involved merchant, as this would greatly assist us in the chargeback dispute process. "" Dear N26.com what to do when merchant simply ignores you? Multiple times in first case I told your agent that ebay is simply ignoring me in my complains, no reasonable human response, but your employee ignored me. He kept to script: Contact merchant. But if the merchant does not respond? What then? Well, er..uhm write them to (Agent digged the email on front of ebay page) info at ebay.com ? And then off course they do not respond.  Sorry dude, no help, you did not get reply from the merchant. At the end you give up. It is not worth your mental health these 50-60 EUR. Well, is that respect of customer?Another epic treatment from N26.com support:I went to pull some money from crappy Eastern European  bank in Xxxyz Crap Country, sure got receipt from ATM, no money, but they charged my account. Haha Fine. Went to bank, obviously they are used to this crap, they said oh, ""probably bank bills got mixed or something."" Yes fine, not my problem what we are going to do, I did not get money and you charged me for warm air.  Well contact your bank. Ok. Went to N26.com support, the support agent told me well contact the bank who owns the ATM. Fine, called bank on phone - they say: ""sure give me your number we will contact somebody in our claiming center or something,and call you back"" After 15 minutes they called back and told me I had to complain to my bank to solve the issue. Okkkk. Went again to chat with another agent who turned out he was capable dude (I think his name was Michael), he asked me for receipt from ATM, I send it, and explained him what was the issue, fine I was thinking they will fixed it. But wait, in day or two there is agent who wrote to me that there is unclear things about my claim and if I can repeat him exactly what happened? I asked him what was unclear in my claim, he continued with canned BS.  I am really tired with this..is this support?You have to explain 3x times same thing? Kinda interrogation or what? What a crap...","Hi John,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.In the event you notice an unauthorised transaction on your account, our dedicated chargeback team will assist in investigating the transaction and do their utmost to reclaim your funds via Mastercard dispute. As both of your cases would have appeared to be merchants you had previously dealt with for authorised transactions, our chargeback team would request that you try your best to make contact with the involved merchant, as this would greatly assist us in the chargeback dispute process. If a transaction is unauthorised, we would require the active card to be blocked and reordered to prevent any future unauthorised transaction on your N26 account. This is a necessary step in the dispute process, and is for the safety and security of your account.Please feel free to reach out to us on Twitter over at @N26_Support so that we can assist you with your case.Update: If the merchant does not respond to you, you would simply need to inform the chargeback agent as we understand that sometimes, merchants may not be responsive. We simply need to know that you have attempted contact for the purpose of the dispute, as your previous transactions would indicate a past relationship with the merchant.

Szabolcs,"I took out a larger sum at an ATM on Tuesday but I needed more for a car purchase so I tried again at the same ATM the next day but this time my withdrawal request was declined because my card was ""not authorised"". I called support and they had basically no clue why my withdrawal had been declined so they went ahead and ""reset"" my card and told me to try again the next day. Which is what I did but my request was again denied so once again I had to contact support, which said my bank card had been blocked for some reason (they couldn't say why). I told them to lift the block manually because I needed the money promptly but they said it took 24 hours so there I was with no access to my money for 2 whole days when I would've needed it urgently. I've been banking with N26 for about a month and that was basically my first experience trying to take out cash from an ATM. I guess I'll have to look for another bank.OK, but why on earth do I not get a notification when my card has been blocked with an explanation why (apparently I didn't wait 24 hours) it was blocked and for how long exactly?

Tigran G.,"A perfect example of merging modern technological approach and traditional banking! I was using local bank for many years, paying additional fees and visiting their office in another city every time I need something from them. One day I decided to switch to N26 due it's online persistence and full-scale bank features. That was a wise solution, so in a couple of months I've closed my local bank account and still happy with that. Very high level of security, nice support team and excellent conditions are making it very attractive for daily use. I had some contactless payment problems on early days but now this passed away.

At that time i had added my n26 account (balance was a little above 0 to my paypal) like i do with my other banks. I had withdrew my paypal money so i pay later using the option "" one time payment with credit card "" .When ebay tried to charge the money from my paypal , n26 debited the amount from my account even if the balance was far less than the fees resulting in a negative balance. They contacted me telling that they will close my account and a debt collection will contact me for the debt. The debt company contacted me telling me to pay the amount i owe + 220 euros or they will file a suit against me if i dont pay in 7 days. Which bank do such things?? Which bank charges an amount on your account when your balance cant cover it?","Hey, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. We're apologise for any miscommunication regarding your N26 account.

John Foote,So as of our departure from the EU n26 has had to close all UK accounts unfortunately due to not using the service for some time I had forgotten my pin usually this is no issue as the app allows you to reset it very easily but this time the reset function was broken and when I contacted customer support they basically implied they either didn't care or couldn't do anything and now I have seeminly lost my account and my funds for good with no hope of retrival,"Hey John, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Fatih Mehmet HAYIRLI,"I used N26 for a period of three maybe a little bit more months. It was a really good user interface and other opportunities but I wanted to change my phone number, which I thought was lost. They asked verification again to do this. I did, Although all my information is legal and true, they didn't accept it. (Date: 20 March 2020)I know that my information is clear, true, and legal. That's why I tried the open my account. I asked them to create a new case and tried to solve this problem for 10-12 days. They didn't solve my problem.They wrote to me that I had to fill in the cancellation document to send me my money. Then I sent an account cancellation document to send the remaining money to my account. (Date: 3 April 2020)5 days later (8 April 2020): Surprise! They said that more documents were needed: Send the scanned IBAN to confirm the process. Scanned IBAN? I didn't even understand. I sent my document again.14 days later (22 April 2020): They sent a more descriptive mail, thank God! 14 days later. It could have been more. They need ""...a scanned copy (PDF) of an official account statement with IBAN related to another bank account..."" I sent it.28 April 2020: Of course! I still haven't received an answer. Were you expecting something different?I would like to thank N26 Customer Service for helping me with limited authority. They are great! Back Office Support? I don't want to talk about them.If you are a corporate company you should never victimize your customers. If you close your account unnecessarily and have money in it, you should quickly send it to another bank account.I already tried to solve my problem from support chat on the website, support@26, and other ways. These steps never worked.","Hey Fatih, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry for the frustrating time you have experienced trying to close your account.

M. C,"EDIT: Modified my review from 1 star to 4, this situation was very time consuming to deal with because I had to go through a lot of different support representatives, but at least they showed goodwill. I was offered half the money I lost, pretty quickly (1 week after the problem emerged). I guess it's still better than traditional banks.They acknowledged their initial mistake they tried to make up for it, which I respect. Thanks Sullivan for your help.---The app /tech is really nice but after that it's only problems after problems. The support staff is nice too, but most of the time not helpful. I lost 70 euros in bank fees after one of their employees misinformed me about my account ID's. A transfer was issued from another country and was rejected because they sent me the wrong account name.After HOURS with the support, several lies from their side trying to cover their mistake they finally agreed that they made an error but are not willing to compensate, not even with a free month of service (which is around 10 euros).","Hey,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.First of all, sorry to hear you have had a negative experience, we would like to help rectify this for you.We are more than happy to help you resolve any issue you may be experiencing and investigate this matter further for you.Can you kindly contact us via our Twitter support @N26_Support, we are very active here and are happy to provide you with further advice.

Patrick St Jean-Taylor,Really convenient bank to have. The fee free ATM access is amazing ð. The only thing I can say to improve is the fact you have to deactivate your card in order to get another card. I like to have multiple cards on hand.

Dimitrios Martinis,"The security of N26 card is very low . All the balance of my card was stolen with 3 transactions within 2 minutes. If you see a very small charge in your card (2 euros) block it immediately because after you will lose all your balance.After 10 days the only feedback i got back from them is a request to order a new card . About the theft nothing. It is a big disappointment this company. I dont trust them anymore.Update: Today 6/5/2020 , 3 weeks after the theft , i have got a message from N26 that they cannot process a payment  Amende site (the thief) because my card has been locked and they advised me to visit the app in order to add another card in order to let the thief steal again .This gave me the impression that they have not taken into any consideration my complain and they cemented my opinion that their safety standards as well as their willingness or ability to help is very low.","Hi Dimitrios,We're sorry to learn that this happened to you.We can assure you that security is our top priority at N26.

BLipa,"-------Update Nr. 1------- N26 team reply here says, "" if you have permanently moved from a supported country to a country in which we do not operate, your bank account must, therefore, be closed,"" however, it was not permanent, obviously. Nonetheless, even if it would have been, no one from the staff has ever bothered to ask me whether it was temporary or permanent! Was I informed about this back then? No, I was not. The email exchange, luckily confirms this. In addition, being that it was temporary, does that mean that the bank can reopen my account? Highly unlikely. The bank says ""If we have had no response for a prolonged period of time about the negative balance, we may then have to pass this on to a third party agency to collect these funds,"" yet, I have clearly asked the bank for instructions and alternatives back then, I have explained my situation, thus my question, was not the staff supposed and obligied to provide me with the information regarding the possibility to set up a repayment plan?Still, I will wait for an official  response to my email regarding my request. I will update this till all this ends, no matter how long it takes. ----------------------------------------------------------------A terrible experience so far and I find it crucial to share it. Through the course of April and May 2019, I have had dozens of long calls and more than ten email exchanges with the staff at N26. In the end, after they were not able to resolve my issue and enable me to have access to my account, they terminated my account with the justification that ""you have moved from Germany to country X"". N26 closed my account just like that, out of nowhere, and at that point, I had a debt of 250 Euros (overdraft). I could not log in anymore in my account, and I could not generate QR codes to top-up my account. Being that my other bank account was located in a non-EU country and did not support SEPA and neither Transferwise nor Paypal, the transfer cost of 250 Euros to close my debt would cost around 30 Euro, so, Euro 250 (debt) plus Euro 30 (transfer fee) equals Euro 280. That was not something I was willing to do. I was never offered another alternative to paying back the debt, besides receiving two email reminders. NB! I was not informed about the possibility to set up a repayment plan to do that as soon as I had access to the EU banking system, as I do now.  Recently, I was contacted by a German debt collection agency, in German, a language that I do not speak nor understand, asking me to pay back around Euro 370. I will not negotiate with e debt collection agency as their claim is baseless, considering the responsibility that N26 had in the way they handled things (I have all the email and transcripts); thus, I contacted today through email N26 with a repayment plan proposal to repay my debt on May 25th, 2020, as like a said, now I have access again in the EU banking system, and I could sort it quickly. However, based on my previous experience with them, I do not think they will cooperate and neither provide an alternative. Remains to be seen and I will update this post as soon as I get an answer.","Hi,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.We regret to learn of this situation and apologise for any inconvenience caused. It is correct that if you have permanently moved from a supported country to a country in which we do not operate, your bank account must therefore be closed. If it is a temporary move for less than 18 months, the account can stay open.In order for an account to be fully closed, the balance must be levelled to zero. If a balance stays in negative for an excessive amount of time, we will issue a number of reminders to the customer to bring the balance to zero. It is then the responsibility of that customer to then level their account balance through necessary means, so as to not incur any additional fees on the debt.If we have had no response for a prolonged period of time about the negative balance, we may then have to pass this on to a third party agency to collect these funds. This must then be resolved directly with the agency.Best Regards,Rudolf Your N26 Support Team",2020-04-16,2020-04-16,1.0,0,2020,Negative

Didn't have money so incurred a â¬3 fee. As I am living back in another country because of covid-19 have no way of putting the money on the account. When i asked them to wave the fee so i could close the account they told me they couldn't and suggested i wire â¬3 from over seas so I could close the account.

Kevin,"It's a fantastic online bank with a few limitations that might not effect you at all.The registration process made me feel that N26 takes security very serious. It can feel a bit excessive but from working in the IT security sector I am very positively impressed.The support is really helpful and easy to reach inside the app via chat. Experienced no waiting times. Agents seemed to have native level English language and understood the issue without requiring me to explain 20 times.The App is easy to use for transferring funds and checking transaction history. I get notified immediately when a transfer is being done, like paying in the store.I would give 5 Stars , if there wasn't this little limitation. As mentioned, this might not effect you at all. Now for the Star reduction :DIf your transferring funds to another account, there are 2 ways. First is using the IBAN of the recipient (very easy and no problems when inside Europe), the other (for international transfers) is a 3rd Party provider (TransferWise). TransferWise is integrated into the N26 App but comes with limitations as well, that it limits the options, potentially forcing you to use their website. There is no option for a ""normal"" transfer (using the Name and bank account information of the recipient allowing for international transfers). Personally I have to transfer funds to a country outside Europe and the limited options in the app force me to use the TransferWise website, sending the funds to TransferWise and when they arrive, they will be forwarded to the recipient. This is delaying the process for several days.As mentioned, if you are not doing international transfers, your will not be effected.
