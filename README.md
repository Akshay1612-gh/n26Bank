My objective for this project was to leverage data-driven insights to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operational efficiency, and support strategic decision-making at N26 Bank. 
By conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews, I identified trends in satisfaction, pinpointed pain points, and highlighted areas of excellence. 
Through metrics such as response times, unanswered reviews, and delays between experiences and reviews, I provided actionable insights to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer support. 
Additionally, by analyzing sentiment shifts and monthly growth rates for positive and negative feedback, I tracked customer perceptions over time, enabling strategies for improved retention and engagement. 
This analysis not only deepened the understanding of customer behavior but also provided the foundation for personalized, data-backed solutions to help N26 deliver an exceptional banking experience.
